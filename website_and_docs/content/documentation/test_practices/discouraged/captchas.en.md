CAPTCHA, short for _Completely Automated Public Turing test
to tell Computers and Humans Apart_,
is explicitly designed to prevent automation, so do not try!
There are two primary strategies to get around CAPTCHA checks:

* Disable CAPTCHAs in your test environment
* Add a hook to allow tests to bypass the CAPTCHA
