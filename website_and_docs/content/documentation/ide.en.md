Selenium's Integrated Development Environment ([Selenium IDE](//selenium.dev/selenium-ide))
is an easy-to-use browser extension that records a user's
actions in the browser using existing Selenium commands,
with parameters defined by the context of each element.
It provides an excellent way to learn Selenium syntax.
It's available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
