### [Open items](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20new%20owner)

* Make TLC Governance more Asynchronous — we discussed the difficulties of getting everyone together. Many of our
meetings end up only being 2 or 3 people, which makes it hard to have the kinds of discussions we want to have.
We're going to try to leave time for TLC members who are not present to weigh in and vote on issues.

### Proposals/Decisions

[List of Needs-Decision Issues](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision)

* Make HTTP Client values consistent ([#12368](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/12368)) — 
this was met positively by members present; per discussion on being more async, we will to get feedback from
TLC members not present and will announce decision at the next meeting.
  * Set Read timeout set to 120 seconds
  * Set Max redirects to 20
  * Make everything configurable

### [4.12 Milestone](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/milestone/13) 
CDP v116 is released August 15, and we want to do a minor release as soon as we can. 
Mostly Bug fixes and Selenium Manager updates
