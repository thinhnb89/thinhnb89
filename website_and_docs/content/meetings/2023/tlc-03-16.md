* 26 outstanding PRs; last meeting: 34

### CDP support

* v111 was released on March 1
* v112 release expected on March 29

### Membership Updates

* No updates

### Proposals/Decisions

[List of Needs-Decision Issues](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision)

* Nothing open but we need to follow up on decisions made in previous meetings

### CI Health

* Several jobs in each binding are failing constantly.
* Health has improved but now Ruby is failing because CDP 111 is missing
* Still need to triage different jobs

### Selenium 4.8.x

It was agreed that the next release of Selenium to support CDP v111 would be a patch
release since the features we want to see in Selenium 4.9 are not yet
implemented in all the bindings.

### Selenium 4.9

[Milestone 4.9](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/milestone/10)

Previous goal: feature complete by Feb 1 (then March 3, but now March 20); 
ideally including examples, docs & blog.
* Driver Finders (only in Java for now)
* Update Selenium Manager output (only Java for now)
* Auto download correct driver for provided browser version or location
* Grid downloads (done! Still docs need update)
