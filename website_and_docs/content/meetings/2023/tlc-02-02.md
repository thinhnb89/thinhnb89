### Proposals/Decisions

[List of Needs-Decision Issues](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision)

* [[js] Add functionality for using "touch" pointer in Actions](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/11570)
  * `needs-decision` label can be removed since agreement through the comments in the issue has been reached.
* [Don't kill chromedriver on CTRL+C](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/11128) 
  * Decision was to not accept this change because it changes the behaviour Python users are used to.
* [[JS] [atoms] Use .textContent instead of .innerHTML in clear() action](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/11504)
  * Decision was to merge it and open an issue in ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver to get the atoms updated in those projects.

### CI Health

* Several tests across bindings failing, need to triage to get a better understanding of what is failing.

### Selenium 4.8.1

* Add CDP v110, update Selenium Manager, and release.

* Auto download correct driver for provided browser version or location

### Selenium 5 - Conversation Starter

* Split out code to better highlight ecosystem

### Projects in Progress
