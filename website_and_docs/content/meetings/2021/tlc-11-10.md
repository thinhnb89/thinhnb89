## Releases

### What is left for 4.1.0?
* Chrome 96 CDP bindings need to be generated for all Selenium bindings
* Shadow DOM support via JS executor across bindings, issue [10019][]
* Seems `FirefoxDriver` is not getting packaged when running tests as a jar, issue [10001][]
    * Troubleshooted by [pujagani][] âœ…

## Documentation
* [PR][] doing a reorg of the English docs, other languages will follow after the merge.

## Planned topics that were not discussed and they remain open
* How do we want to handle patches? E.g. 4.0.x
    * Two main ideas were discussed
        * Do not tag patch releases and if Grid, .NET or IEServer have a patch release, upload those binaries to the nearest minor release.
        * Tag patch releases, and if Grid, .NET or IEServer are not released in the patch, add a text file that contains the URL where the latest release is. E.g. `LATEST_IEDRIVER_SERVER_WIN_32`, with the contents: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/download/selenium-3.150.0/IEDriverServer_Win32_3.150.2.zip. As a matter of fact, all releases would need that. More details during the release, but our release history would be much cleaner.
* Conversation starter: What do we want in Selenium 5?

## Topics that came during the meeting (or previous ones) but were left open
* Aligning features across bindings before doing a release, mentioned by [titusfortner][]
* Setting Java 11 as minimum Java version, mentioned by [titusfortner][]
    * Relevant resources: https://snyk.io/jvm-ecosystem-report-2021/ and https://www.jrebel.com/blog/2021-java-technology-report
