***

## Open issues and PR that need attention
* Removal of legacy W3C endpoints in Python - https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10031
    * They will be removed from JavaScript and Python, but not Java. The Grid still needs them to offer support for JWP.
    * JWP is not supported, but access is still temporarily provided.


## Releases

### How do we want to handle patches? E.g. 4.0.x
* We will not tag the tree when there is a patch release.
* If there are new assets (Selenium Server, etc...), they get uploaded to the previous release.
    * E.g. If we release patch 4.1.1, assets get uploaded to 4.1.0

### What do we want in 4.2.0?
* Handling actions class methods - https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9996

## Documentation
* [PR][] doing a reorg of the English docs, other languages will follow after the merge.

## Planned topics that were not discussed and they remain open
* Conversation starter: What do we want in Selenium 5?

## Topics that came during the meeting (or previous ones) but were left open
* Aligning features across bindings before doing a release, mentioned by [titusfortner][]
* Setting Java 11 as minimum Java version, mentioned by [titusfortner][]
    * Relevant resources: https://snyk.io/jvm-ecosystem-report-2021/ and https://www.jrebel.com/blog/2021-java-technology-report
