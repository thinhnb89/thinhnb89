## Welcome new TLC members
The TLC has two new members: [p0deje][] and [pujagani][]. Welcome ðŸŽ‰

## Releases

### What do we want in 4.1.0?
* An important pull request changing [SearchContext.findElements][] for the Java bindings to make Appium's life easier. However, if merged it would break Kotlin code, affecting Kotlin users. We need to double check how to avoid that. However, seems the Appium project merged a pull request to [Remove selenium package override][]. [diemol][] will check with the Appium project to find next steps.
    * Update: Pull request was closed after chatting with Mykola from the Appium team. They do not need it anymore as they made changes to avoid needing it, see this [Appium pull request][] âœ…
* Ideally, Java & Grid should fix the following issues before the next release:
    * https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9976
        * Fixed: [dd5dddb][] âœ…
    * https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9980
        * Fixed: [ca9b451][] âœ…
    * https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9988
        * A prerelease was done to get feedback and see if it was fixed for them. ðŸ•§
    * https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9960
        * Fixed: [cbb2796][] âœ…
    * https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9528
* JavaScript will ideally have this fixed https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9993
    * Fixed through this [JS pull request][] âœ…
* New IE Driver release âœ…

## Planned topics that were briefly discussed and they remain open
* How do we want to handle patches? E.g. 4.0.x
    * Two main ideas were discussed
        * Do not tag patch releases and if Grid, .NET or IEServer have a patch release, upload those binaries to the nearest minor release.
        * Tag patch releases, and if Grid, .NET or IEServer are not released in the patch, add a text file that contains the URL where the latest release is. E.g. `LATEST_IEDRIVER_SERVER_WIN_32`, with the contents: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/download/selenium-3.150.0/IEDriverServer_Win32_3.150.2.zip. As a matter of fact, all releases would need that. More details during the release, but our release history would be much cleaner.
* Conversation starter: What do we want in Selenium 5?

## Topics that came during the meeting but were left open
* Aligning features across bindings before doing a release, mentioned by [titusfortner][]
* Setting Java 11 as minimum Java version, mentioned by [titusfortner][]
