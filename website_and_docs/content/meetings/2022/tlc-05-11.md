### CDP support
For the first time in forever we are completely up to date on Chrome 101 in all bindings! Next version (v102)
will happen in 2 weeks.

### Membership Updates
A proposal was made to add [symonk] to the Selenium triage team. Consensus was reached and they will be added.

### PLC status update
* Chicago Conference status - Contract negotiations are underway with the Voca hotel in Chicago
* PLC new members - actively in talks with one person; looking into other suggestions; would like someone in Europe.
* Conference Website - hasn't been updated since White October ran it; working on it

### Github permission updates
Proposal is:
>Only TLC / PLC members as repo “owners”. Everyone else changes role from “admin” to “maintainer”

Context:

> There are 2 levels of permissions. Organization and Team
> Organization is Owner/Member
> Owners get to change things for the org
> For the team, both "admin" and "maintainer" can commit directly to trunk, but "admin" can change settings, etc

So the proposal is essentially to allow all committers to continue to commit things to trunk, 
but limit additional settings changes to TLC/PLC members

Proposal was voted and consensus was reached, so it will be implemented.

### Proposal: Prevent Chrome w3c: false? https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10448

>Essentially people are asking for JWP session and getting a weird response because bindings no longer support it

Proposal was voted and consensus was reached, so it will be implemented. When detected, we should throw 
a `SessionNotCreatedException` so it fails early.

#### Proposal: Delete IME support; Contact applicable w3c working group? https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10573

IME does not work in Selenium but it is being used in Appium, in these routes

```
‘/session/:sessionId/ime/available_engines’: {
    GET: {command: ‘availableIMEEngines’},
  },
  ‘/session/:sessionId/ime/deactivate’: {
    POST: {command: ‘deactivateIMEEngine’},
  },
  ‘/session/:sessionId/ime/activate’: {
    POST: {command: ‘activateIMEEngine’, payloadParams: {required: [‘engine’]}},
  },
```

and access right now is only via the `JsonHttpCommandHandler` which means it is a legacy session.

Comment from the Appium project lead:
>that shouldn’t be a problem as we can move the commands into the appium clients, but would help if you can 
>create an issue at appium/appium explaining what’s up so we understand what’s going on and what we need to do

Then, we need to create an issue in the Appium repo and then delete the code from the Java codebase.

#### Selenium 4.2

Outstanding items before release:

* Deprecate JWP in Java/Grid (Log message, blog post)
  * PR to be merged https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/10408
  * A blog post still needs to be published and linked to the logged warning
* Scroll Wheel Support (example code in docs)
  * Some docs exist already https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/actions_api/wheel/

### Selenium 4.3
On the agenda for future consideration, was not discussed in meeting due to lack of time.
