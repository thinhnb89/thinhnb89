* Remove ELEMENT — #6393 (Java-only) (OPEN)
* Add tests for JWP to assist in transition to w3c-only — #10374 (Java-only) (OPEN)
* v105 support

### Selenium Backlog

List of major project ideas that could be pursued by Selenium Devs.

* Codify BiDi API 
* Add TouchActions API to Selenium 
* Comprehensive Documentation w/Executable Examples 
* Fix Bazel support in .NET 
  * [shs96c] said he needed to get together with [jimevans] for this
* Better API for IE Mode in Edge 
* Complete TypeHints in Python 
* Add .rbs files in Ruby
* Selenium + Appium consolidation 
* Comprehensive command logging across languages 
* Rewrite atoms in TypeScript


### Selenium 5

Discussed that one option for Selenium 5 is implementing the non-backward compatible changes we've discussed:
* Java 11 requirement
* Python Async rewrite
* .Net Async rewrite

Discussed another option for Selenium 5 being "batteries included" release to include:
* Auto Browser downloads
* Auto Driver downloads
* Finish adding Typing hints in Python
* Convert JS to use Type Script
* Possibly add rbs files for Ruby typing
* Other things that cause friction for new users(?)
