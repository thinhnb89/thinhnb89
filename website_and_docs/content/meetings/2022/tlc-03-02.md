Meetings are happening on the `#selenium-tlc` channel on [Selenium Slack](https://selenium.dev/support).

## Agenda
* Releases
    * Any TLC member should be able to release any language, though ideally with agreement from language maintainer
    * Process needs documentation — https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Releasing-Selenium
    * Proposal — Add personal accounts for TLC members to rubygems, pypi, nuget, maven/sonatype
* Chrome 99 has been released, so we need to do a patch release in JS, Python, Java(?), .NET
* Protocol Conversion
  * Current code falls far short of what we've expected it is doing — https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10374
  * This conversion code has a large maintenance burden for current Java maintainers
  * Many different ways we can do this — start removing in 4.0, figure out a toggle with a warning, prep a 5.0
* Scroll Wheel support options
  * Bare minimum- https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/common/actions/wheel_actions.py#L32-L34
  * Above with a tutorial
  * Add user friendly methods (https://gist.github.com/titusfortner/716e108a813dbce601c25cb250c01925, 
  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/interactions/wheel_actions.rb)
* Delete `HTMLRunner`, used for old Selenium IDE tests. This is part of the Java tree.
* Stop releasing Selenium RC and wait 6/9 months before deleting code?

### Releases
[titusfortner][] will give TLC folks access to the RubyGems, [AutomatedTester][] will do
the same for PyPI, [diemol][] will do the same for SonaType, and [jimevans][] will do
the same for Nuget.

Each maintainer will check the docs for releasing.

### Chrome 99 has been released
Each binding will do a release soon to include it.

### Protocol Conversion
TLC members decided that Grid should start throwing warnings when protocol conversion is done,
and if possible add a flag to toggle this behaviour. Then after two releases, we should start
removing this. A blog post needs to be written about this to communicate the upcoming changes.
Warnings and toggle could ideally land in 4.2.0 or 4.3.0.

### Scroll Wheel support
Java is the only binding that does not have any scroll implementation. This needs to be added
and then it can be released with the other bindings. Some bindings have a user friendly
implementation and others is very basic, it can be released like that but we should iterate on
making methods more frienly and also write docs about it.

### `HTMLRunner` and stop releasing Selenium RC
We have decided to remove the `HTMLRunner` given that it is used to run tests created in the old
Selenium IDE, and it is not supported anymore.

Selenium RC is not supported either but we still release it. We will stop releasing it and wait
6 months for community feedback, and if nothing relevant comes up, the code will be deleted.
