Discussed we won't be able to support Python 3.8 with Python for *reasons*
Discussed we also need to figure out better Bazel + .NET support

### Selenium 5

(we did this one out of order from the agenda)

Discussed that one option for Selenium 5 is implementing the non-backward compatible changes we've discussed:
* Java 11 requirement
* Python Async rewrite
* .Net Async rewrite

Discussed another option for Selenium 5 being "batteries included" release to include:
* Auto Browser downloads
* Auto Driver downloads
* Finish adding Typing hints in Python
* Convert JS to use Type Script
* Possibly add rbs files for Ruby typing
* Other things that cause friction for new users(?)
 
### Selenium Backlog

List of major project ideas that could be pursued by Selenium Devs.

* Codify BiDi API 
* Support automatic browser and driver installation by default 
* Add TouchActions API to Selenium 
* Comprehensive Documentation w/Executable Examples 
* Fix Bazel support in .NET 
* Better API for IE Mode in Edge 
* Complete TypeHints in Python 
* Selenium + Appium consolidation 
* Comprehensive command logging across languages 
* Rewrite atoms in TypeScript

Briefly discussed:
* BiDi will be worked on at Test Automation Summit
* Bazel support with .NET — [shs96c] said he needed to get together with [jimevans] for this
* Rewriting atoms in TypeScript attempt by [AutomatedTester] missing a second step
