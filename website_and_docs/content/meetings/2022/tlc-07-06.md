Open issues got up to 108 earlier in the week. Lots of work to keep them low

### Membership Updates

### PLC status update
PLC Meeting happened 7/5 but have not yet gotten a full report on it

* Chicago Conference status - Waiting for hotel contract to be signed for conference the week of March 27, 2023
* Test Automation Summit, Berlin - 3-day event the week of August 22, 2022
  * Aug 24 - BiDi working session with browser vendors and Selenium devs (Google & Mozilla sending reps, waiting to hear from Apple and Microsoft)
  * Aug 25 - Project maintainers meeting (maintainers from Selenium, Appium, WebdriverIO, Watir, Selenide, FluentLenium, SerenityJS, Robot Framework are committed to it, and waiting to hear back from one more)
  * Aug 26 - Public Working session for ~12 people

### Selenium 4.4: Name TBD
* Opera classes 
  * We removed Opera classes from Selenium because operadriver is not w3c compliant and Opera can use chromedriver
  * Opera browser no longer works with chromedriver (different errors on Mac & Windows)
  * Options:
    * Do nothing â€” not enough people use Opera, so low priority
    * Tell users to use Selenium < 4.2 with `w3c: true` if they need Opera 
    * Add Opera classes back
  * Decision was not to do anything without hearing back from operadriver developers
* Need plan for removing protocol conversion code from Java/Grid
  * We have a 3-step Plan
    1. Remove `makew3csafe` so that we still handshake, but only pass in what user provides 
    2. Remove the handshake that tries to send both W3C & JWP 
    3. Remove all support for JWP
  * Removing `makew3csafe` has been more difficult than expected
  * We should add tests to ensure that subsequent steps should still work as part of accomplishing previous steps

Meeting was ended here due to participants needing to leave.
