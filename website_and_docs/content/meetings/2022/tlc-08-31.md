v106 is scheduled for September 27

### Membership Updates

### Proposals

None at this time

### CI Health

CI is broken for a new bug in Firefox. [titusfortner] volunteere to investigate

### Selenium 4.5

Discussed that there are not a lot of blog-worthy features yet, but that once CI
is passing it is still worth making a release. Current features include
* Java 11 client, 
* Dev and Beta versions for Docker Containers
* CDP 105
* The fix for Low Concurrency Grid bug (possibly)

But also we need to write a blog post for it as part of the release.

### Projects in Progress

Selenium Manager — [bonigarcia] actively working on it
BiDi API work — there was an official w3c working group meeting last week, and it was announced
that Puppeteer would be using the new WebDriver BiDi. The current plan is for Selenium to change
its implementation from WebDriver-Classic to WebDriver-BiDi.
Figuring out the API across the languages is an important next step for the team.
