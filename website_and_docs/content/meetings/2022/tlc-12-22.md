### Proposals/Decisions

[List of Needs-Decision Issues](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision)

* [#11410: What's the Deal with Driver Logging?](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/11410) 

It was decided to:
  1. Not to do [11404](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/11404)
  2. Deprecate Java ChromeOptions usage of setting Log Level
  3. Ensure all Service classes can set logs for the drivers (including Safari)
  4. Blog about why people should set logging in Service class instead of Options class for Firefox

* This is not in a GitHub issue per se, but let's note that the TLC agreed to:

Request Google Cloud Storage account for Remote Bazel Caching $500-750/mo
