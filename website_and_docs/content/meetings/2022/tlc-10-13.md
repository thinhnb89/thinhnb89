* 25 outstanding PRs; last meeting: 19

### CDP support

* v105 & v106 added to Selenium v4.5
* v107 scheduled October 25

### Membership Updates

* Corina Pip added to PLC!

### Proposals

* [Disallow using SelectList class for disabled select lists](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10812)
  * Decision: Reverting the part preventing people from using it to get info from options elements in disabled select 
    lists and keeping the part about erroring when attempting to select an option that is disabled.

* [Deprecate FirefoxProfile except to zip existing profiles](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/11118)
  * Decision: Deprecate everything, including things that work and have FirefoxProfile *only be used for zipping 
    existing profiles; all other tweaks must use capabilities.

* [Switch headless methods to new headless mode (or remove)](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/11099)
  * Decision: Deprecate and remove the convenience method, users would need to set it in the args. A blog post
    explaining the decision is needed.

* [BiDi proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dCd8Y2PYaR5mOGSmNTwllEHNmFqegfoGkP-TCKvPzSU/edit#)
