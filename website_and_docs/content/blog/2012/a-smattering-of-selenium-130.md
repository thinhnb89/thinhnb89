Canâ€™t get enough Se bloggage? Have a look at [Overview of Selenium Blogs](http://itkosmopolit.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/overview-of-selenium-blogs/) â€” though I must say there has to be something wrong with the Alexa algorithm if I am that far down the list. And behind both David and Alister. ðŸ™‚

*   [Must Have Git Aliases: Advanced Examples](http://durdn.com/blog/2012/11/22/must-have-git-aliases-advanced-examples/) reminds me of someone I used to work with who likely couldnâ€™t function on a clean unix system, but with all his aliases was mind blowing to watch
*   [Writing a Selenium Test Framework for a Django Site (Part 3)](http://techblog.safaribooksonline.com/2012/11/23/writing-a-selenium-test-framework-for-a-django-site-part-3/) has the usual myths and FUD around XPath and embeds locators in the script method but is the first thing Iâ€™ve seen that uses the Color class in Python so Iâ€™ll overlook those things. This time.
*   [How to solve Selenium focus issues](https://makandracards.com/makandra/12661-how-to-solve-selenium-focus-issues) introduced me to jQueryâ€™s :focus pseudoselector
*   Iâ€™m sure there is something to be learned from [Use Rails until it hurts](http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/articles/2012/11/21/use-rails-until-it-hurts/). Especially from the paragraph above the twitter inclusions
*   [Checking an image is actually visible using WebDriver](http://watirmelon.com/2012/11/27/checking-an-image-is-actually-visible-using-webdriver/) is something I plan on stealing.
*   [Android 4.0 in VirtualBox](http://www.kirsle.net/blog/kirsle/android-4-0-in-virtualbox) seems like a cool way to build out an android build farm
*   [Autoloading in PHP and the PSR-0 Standard](http://phpmaster.com/autoloading-and-the-psr-0-standard/) has some Symfony specific bits, but is generally useful
*   [Extending Selenium with jQuery](http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2012/11/19/extending-selenium-with-jquery/) is something else I intend to steal
*   From the same person is [Combining py.test and Selenium to test webapps](http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2012/11/15/combining-py-test-and-selenium-to-test-webapps/) which shows off some of what py.test can do with fixtures. Not how I would do it, but cool none the less.
*   Let me say this again; the officially blessed solution for getting response codes is to route your calls through a proxy (like the BrowserMob Proxy) and then ask it what they were. But if you are bound and determined to craft â€˜solutionsâ€™ that only work in a single browser, or a single language, or require changing your application then [How To Get The HTTP Status Code In Selenium WebDriver](http://www.ninthavenue.com.au/how-to-get-the-http-status-code-in-selenium-webdriver) will make good breakfast reading.
