Two days in a row! Take that doubters!

*   [Automated Software Testing: An Example of a Working Solution](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1874863) is an interesting take on designing an automation system for the US DoD. It sure as heck isnâ€™t how I would do it, but I can understand how this context might lead to this solution. And it seems like it is Eclipse based which is even worse a decision. ðŸ™‚
*   [5 Tips on Finding a Mobile Job in Toronto](http://www.devto.ca/2012/05/5-tips-on-finding-a-mobile-job-in-toronto/) is pretty focused, but also applies to non-mobile jobs outside of Toronto.
*   [Application Cache: Douchebag](http://speakerdeck.com/u/jaffathecake/p/application-cache-douchebag) is another one of those things you need to grok if you are going to automate HTML5 goodies
*   Before you run your automation against an Android app, you might want to run [Android Lint](http://tools.android.com/tips/lint) against it.
*   [wd-sync](https://github.com/sebv/node-wd-sync) is a synchronous version of the [wd](https://github.com/admc/wd) javascript bindings.
*   [Abmash](https://github.com/alp82/abmash) aims to deal with the element location problem only using the visible cues a user could see. In my experience, this leads to scripts that work fine â€” until you need to deal with multiple languages at which point it falls on its face. Hard. Butâ€¦
*   [Improving your code with modern idioms](http://python3porting.com/improving.html) is Python focused and is something I need to keep open whenever I write new codeâ€¦
*   More on Jasmine â€“ [Confidence.js](https://speakerdeck.com/u/searls/p/confidencejs)
*   [Gas Mask](http://www.clockwise.ee/gasmask/) seems like it would be pretty cool. There are of course some bugs, and the project seems rather dormant. Oh. And writing Objective C is a painâ€¦ but I really want something like this!
*   [Automatically download and install VirtualBox guest additions in Vagrant](http://blog.carlossanchez.eu/2012/05/03/automatically-download-and-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-vagrant/). Yup. Thatâ€™s what it does.
