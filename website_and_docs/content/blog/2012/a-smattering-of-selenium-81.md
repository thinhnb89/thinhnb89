Its March Break (at least here) which means its also Catch Up Week. An extra long Smattering every day!

*   Generally I reccomend to people not to automate file uploads, but sometimes they are unavoidable. [Selenium Tips: Uploading Files in Remote WebDriver](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2012/03/selenium-tips-uploading-files-in-remote-webdriver/) explains how one might go about things in WebDriver
*   [HTTP Status Cats](http://www.flickr.com/photos/girliemac/sets/72157628409467125/) isn’t new, but is still funny.
*   [httpstatus.es](http://httpstatus.es/) has the same information, but organized slightly differently. Now for someone to make a mashup of the two
*   [Coypu](https://github.com/coypu/coypu) appears to be a .NET wrapper around WebDriver
*   From this year’s CodeMash, [Continuous Integration in the Mobile World](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Continuous-Integration-in-the-Mobile-World)
*   Like rake but like Python more? Now you can use [shovel](https://github.com/seomoz/shovel)
*   [Plasma](https://github.com/jennifersmith/plasma) is another C# framework that has WebDriver-ness in it for automating ASP.NET apps
*   [Zonebie](https://github.com/highgroove/zonebie) is a gem that can inject different timezones into your scripts to see if they are sensitive to that sort of thing.
*   [Tool mania](http://davenicolette.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/tool-mania/) is a useful reminder that sometimes Se can be a wrench.
*   What’s your team’s [Precommit Process](http://jayflowers.com/WordPress/?p=232)?
*   [DevOps DNS for Developers – Now There’s No Excuse Not To Know](http://www.diaryofaninja.com/blog/2012/03/03/devops-dns-for-developers-ndash-now-therersquos-no-excuse-not-to-know) because there is now no excuse not to know
*   [Toying with Context Managers](http://tomerfiliba.com/blog/Toying-with-Context-Managers/) explains this bit of Python syntax sugar
*   If you are looking to raise the ire of the Se devs, [Xcode just doesn’t work worth shit](http://openradar.appspot.com/10597149) is a good example. Not that I recommend it. But yes, I did laugh when reading it.
*   Does your app have a REST API? Do you test it using Se? Stop! Its not the right tool. Once you understand REST you’ll see why and [RESTful API Server – Doing it the right way (Part 1)](http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/articles/restful-api-server-doing-it-the-right-way-part-1/) does a decent job explaining things.
*   [(Really Really) Understanding traceroute](http://blog.cachefly.com/2012/02/15/understanding-traceroute/) is one of those everyday tools that people think they understand, but often don’t.
*   [No Wrong Answers: Questions for Pre‑Clients](http://weblog.muledesign.com/2012/02/no_wrong_answers_questions_for.php) apply just as much for automation projects
*   [Web-Drawing Throwdown: Paper.js Vs. Processing.js Vs. Raphael](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/22/web-drawing-throwdown-paper-processing-raphael/) illustrates these three canvas libraries. Now, who is going to produce the demo Se scripts to interact with these. Canvas is coming and its kinda scary.
*   [Automating Web Performance Stats Collection in .NET](http://www.adathedev.co.uk/2012/02/automating-web-performance-stats.html) talks about the BrowserMobProxy with .NET
*   [Serializing python-requests’ Session objects for fun and profit](http://sharats.me/serializing-python-requests-session-objects-for-fun-and-profit.htm) is a bit of code spelunking and a useful bit of code as well.
*   [Processing Text Files in Python 3](http://readthedocs.org/docs/ncoghlan_devs-python-notes/en/latest/py3k_text_file_processing.html) is going to be more and more important whether we are ready or not.
