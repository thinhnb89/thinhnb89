Look at that! 3 days in a row, and the boy isn’t even gone to school yet and I’ve hit ‘publish’

*   Most people know about this already, but [SeleniumConf](http://www.youtube.com/seleniumconf) has its own YouTube channel — which has all of the 2012 videos on it now.
*   [How to Dynamically Add Android Support to Selenium Server at Runtime](https://gist.github.com/2493103)
*   [Python Iteration](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html) is a beginner talk about, well, iterating in Python. In ways that you would expect (for) and ways that you wouldn’t (generators)
*   [Sleepy Automated Tests](http://www.testingmentor.com/imtesty/2012/06/11/sleepy-automated-tests/) talks about polling loops. I like the use of the phrase _periodic comatose states_
*   [Wait! Using Selenium Web Driver with jQuery animations](http://randonom.com/blog/2012/04/wait-using-selenium-web-driver-with-jquery-animations/) could be something you want to stash into your base classes if you are using JQuery
*   If you are using Robot Framework, [robotframework-httplibrary](https://github.com/peritus/robotframework-httplibrary) and [robotframework-requests](https://github.com/bulkan/robotframework-requests) could be of interest to do all the things on your site that don’t need a browser to actually be involved

*   Driving your iOS app from CoffeeScript? Sure! [Introducing Bwoken](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/lab_projects/2012/4/introducing-bwoken)
*   [Selenium and Quality Center Integration using NUnit](http://www.agiletestware.com/selenium-qc-nunit/) could be valuable for .NET shops wanting to integrate things with QC. Though looking at the arrows the scripts are still run from VS — there is money to be made running them from QC and not just using it as a result repo.
*   [PHP Hammer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/raindrift/sets/72157629492908038/with/7095238893/) is just about the best response to snark ever
