In this series of blog posts weâ€™ve introduced one of the keynotes and talked about some of the great presentations youâ€™ll see at Selenium Conf â€™12, but so far weâ€™ve missed the most important aspect of the entire event: you.

For me, one of the highlights of any conference is the chance to meet other members of the community, make new friends and talk about all things interesting (and perhaps even tangentially related to the conference!) To help this process along, weâ€™ve avoided scheduling everything down to the last minute. Instead, weâ€™ve left plenty of time in the B track for an unconference. Youâ€™ll get to pick the talks and have a chance to have your voice heard. Last year, there were some great talks on the equivalent track, and I think weâ€™ll see the same this year too!

If the idea of standing up and talking for 30 minutes in front of an audience seems a little daunting, you can dip your toes in the water by volunteering for a lightning talk: 5 minutes of concentrated goodness! Come prepared with a topic and perhaps a handful of slides ðŸ™‚

Itâ€™s not all formal talks, either. As well as the many members of the selenium community whoâ€™ll be attending the conference, there will be many of the core development team. Thereâ€™ll be a chance to ask Simon why weâ€™re not using git yet, get feedback on some of the ways youâ€™re using Selenium, or just chew the fat. There will be a drinks on the 17th at a London pub, too.

Iâ€™m really looking forward to meeting all of you, and hearing the tall testing stories, and finding out how youâ€™re pushing the boundaries. of web automation. If youâ€™ve still not [bought a ticket](http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/), thereâ€™s still time to. Come along and join us! If youâ€™ve already bought your ticket, what kind of things are you looking forward to?
