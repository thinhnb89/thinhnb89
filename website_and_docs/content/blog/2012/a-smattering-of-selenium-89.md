Figured I would get this out before the computer goes in for surgery.

*   [Automate Page Load Performance Testing with Firebug and Selenium](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/automate-page-load-performance-testing-with-firebug-and-selenium/) is not a new topic, but a timely one for me
*   [Speed up your features with a backdoor login route](http://itshouldbeuseful.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/speed-up-your-features-with-a-backdoor-login-route/) is not a recent post, but something I’ve had to explain to people at least once a week for the past month, so…
*   [RSpec’s New Expectation Syntax](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax) explains not only the ‘what’ of the new syntax but the ‘why’
*   [Slides & Videos from LDNSE #6](http://bitly.com/bundles/undeleterious/1) does not falsely advertise itself
*   [Python Timer Class – Context Manager for Timing Code Blocks](http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.ca/2012/06/python-timer-class-context-manager-for.html) reminds me that I need to use Context Managers more often
*   [Overloading Python list comprehension](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2012/03/overloading-python-list-comprehension.html?m=1) is an interesting little experiment. Well, depending on your definition of interesting I suppose
*   I posted the about how Python creates classes last week, and going through the queue of things I have to post came across [Python object creation sequence](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/04/16/python-object-creation-sequence/) from the same blog
*   [Visual Studio 11 Fakes Part 1 – Stubs](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/04/15/visual-studio-11-fakes-part-1/) discussed the Fakes framework which appears to ship in VS11. Stubs. Are. Awesome. Oh, and it took too much work to find it, but [Visual Studio Fakes Part 2 – Shims](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/04/25/visual-studio-11-fakes-part-2/) is the follow-up. Actually, if you are VS all day there are a bunch of neat things on that blog.
*   I don’t own a copy, but [The Grumpy Programmer’s Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications](http://grumpy-testing.com/) but the section breakdown seems like it would be correct.
*   [Test on Real Mobile Devices Without Breaking the Bank](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/) has some food for thought. And its own quirky definition of ‘bank’. Especially given that the half-life of a mobile OS is something like 7 months it seems.
