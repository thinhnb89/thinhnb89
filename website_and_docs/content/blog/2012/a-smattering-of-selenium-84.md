What? Its only been 3 months since the last one. Sheesh.

*   Sorry about being a G+ article, but [DOM Ready](https://plus.google.com/116910304844117268718/posts/UkaymyuTzaF) discusses briefly about how to build your page in terms of order of events. Of course, if you read the comments it is very much buyer beware, but…
*   I’ve been fixating a bit on operational dashboards the last little while and [Enterprise Operational Intelligence](http://blogs.splunk.com/2012/06/07/splunkx-enterprise-operational-intelligence/) has a couple good ones
*   Looking to use BrowserID? There’s a [Page Object](https://github.com/davehunt/bidpom) for that.
*   [Lessons from Etsy: Avoiding Kitchen Nightmares](http://www.slideshare.net/mcdonnps/lessons-from-etsy-avoiding-kitchen-nightmares-chefconf-2012) starts with an oven belching flame and gets better from there
*   [Roll your own page objects](http://watirmelon.com/2012/06/04/roll-your-own-page-objects/), is, for the record how I do Page Objects too. Well, aside from using something like Cucumber as _just_ a functional runner
*   [Rachmaninov’s Third Piano Concerto, Played by Selenium](https://gist.github.com/2735065) is just cool
*   [Splitting Robot Framework tests into batches for parallel execution](http://www.bitrite.fi/johannes/2012/05/11/splitting-robot-framework-tests-into-batches-for-parallel-execution/) is one solution to the ‘my batches were balanced but now they are not’ problem
*   [The Long Tail of Technical Debt](http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2012/05/the-long-tail-of-technical-debt.html) shows one way of parsing run information and suggests what do do with this particular outcome pattern
*   [Bugwatch](https://engineering.groupon.com/2012/misc/bugwatch/) is magic, but magic can be fun too! Well, sometimes.
*   And lastly,
