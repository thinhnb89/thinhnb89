Well, might not be in Florida, but how about them juggernaut Blue Jays?

*   [WebDriver: capture JS errors while running tests](http://mguillem.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/webdriver-capture-js-errors-while-running-tests/) is a JS way of capturing JS errors on a page
*   [Selenium reports – our take](http://www.deepshiftlabs.com/sel_blog/?p=1840&lang=en-us) is a pretty detailed report on one company’s drive for prettier report output
*   Hmmm. How do we get a Selenium [coderwall achievement](http://coderwall.com/achievements)?
*   [page-objects](https://github.com/iainrose/page-objects) is _A basic framework for running automated tests using WebDriver, TestNG & Gradle_
*   [selenese-runner](https://github.com/DBC-as/selenese-runner) is a js runner of Selenese scripts including a JUnit style reporter. Could be a baby-step towards getting Selenese stuff into a CI server
*   I wonder how much time can be shaved off the average suite by implementing HTTP Compression correctly; [Lose the Wait: HTTP Compression](http://zoompf.com/blog/2012/02/lose-the-wait-http-compression)
*   [LessPainful](https://www.lesspainful.com/) looks interesting for mobile stuff. It uses a Cucumber variant so might have Se under the hood there somewhere.
*   What? You don’t read Etsy’s ‘Code As Craft’? Here is a good starting point; [The Etsy Way](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/02/13/the-etsy-way/)
*   [red, green, refactor – the tools for success](http://highgroove.com/articles/2012/02/07/red%2C-green%2C-refactor---the-tools-for-success.html) shows just how large the toolchain can become. Oh. And step six is critical.
*   And remember kids, [there’s no kill switch on awesome](http://www.dilbert.com/2012-02-11/)
