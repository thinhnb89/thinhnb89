Century!

*   [Event 1028 – Automatic Download Blocking](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565669(v=vs.85).aspx) looks like something that could be useful to have tucked away in your head somewhere
*   I think I said I wasn’t going to link to _headless gem_ posts, but I don’t think I’ve linked to one about Cucumber. [Cucumber running headless Selenium with Jenkins (the easy way)](http://sermoa.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/cucumber-running-headless-selenium-with-jenkins-the-easy-way/); fixed
*   [Errorception](http://errorception.com/), and things like it, are the next wave of infrastructure to come I think now that things like BrowserMob Proxy are becoming mainstream-ish-er
*   I’m not really sure of the difference between [NPageObject.Selenium](https://github.com/benaston/NPageObject.Selenium) and [NPageObject](https://github.com/benaston/NPageObject). But if you are using .NET perhaps you’ll be interested enough to dig in.

*   [Bromine](http://cheggeng.github.com/Bromine/) has been released. No. Not _that_ bromine that was associated with Selenium for years. This one is an Event.js based project for automation. Innocent naming conflict, indifference — or SEO land grab? (Just teasing…)
*   [Test automation at HomeSwap.com](http://filipin.eu/test-automation-at-homeswap-com/) is likely watir based, but likely worth a view anyways. (Like how I say that implying like I don’t have 15 weeks of videos backlogged already…)
*   [What’s new in IronPython 2.7.3](http://blog.ironpython.net/2012/07/whats-new-in-ironpython-273.html) is of note if you are stuck in a .NET environment but dislike it…
*   [What makes a good test suite?](http://arlobelshee.com/what-makes-a-good-test-suite) is an interesting like of respondents
