Eventually I’ll get back on the once-a-week schedule. But not today!

*   [Falsehoods Programmers believe about Time](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4128208). Time is hard; let’s go shopping!
*   Speaking of hard. [Concurrency is not Parallelism (it’s better)](http://concur.rspace.googlecode.com/hg/talk/concur.html) — also has gophers
*   Did Netflix actually [Open Source Army of Cloud Monkeys](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/netflix_monkeys/all/1)? I don’t see anything on their [github](https://github.com/netflix) account (and that is the trendy place to release stuff these days)
*   ![](https://i0.wp.com/cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/18503305.jpg)Need I say more?
*   I’ve used this trick a couple times [Python introspection – how to check current module / line of call from within function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5326539/python-introspection-how-to-check-current-module-line-of-call-from-within-fu)
*   Ah-ha! PHP is not the only language with multiple bindings! [webdry](https://bitbucket.org/niklasl/webdry) is _a Python (jquery-inspired) wrapper for DRY:er access to the Selenium WebDriver._
*   [Integrating jQuery With Selenium](http://code-thrill.blogspot.in/2012/04/integrating-jquery-with-selenium.html) talks about the js executor and using jquery instead of the browser’s native locator stuff. I’m not sure I would do this, but it seems like one of those things that people are want to do…
*   I really don’t know the backstory to [Record! Playback? #Fail](http://recordplaybackfail.com/) but it is kinda amusing
*   [Checking as an enabler for testing](https://blog.houseoftest.se/2012/03/26/checking-as-an-enabler-for-testing/) will annoy some since it follows the ‘testing vs checking’ distinction, but is bang on.
*   More reasons to go shopping! [Pragmatic Unicode](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html)
