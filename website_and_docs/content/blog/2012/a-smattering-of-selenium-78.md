Look! A light at the end of the tunnel!

*   [ASP.NET MVC + Selenium + IISExpress](http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2011/12/22/asp-net-mvc-selenium-iisexpress.aspx) â€“ You donâ€™t see too many Windows how-toâ€™s. Not sure if they just donâ€™t get tweeted about or is more a sign of that community.
*   [Write Logs for Machines, use JSON](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/12/26/log-for-machines-in-json/) is a nice idea. I wonder if (when) the major CI containers will land on a pseudo-standard for consuming JSON
*   [Remote File Upload using Selenium 2â€™s FileDetectors](https://gist.github.com/1508946) shows yet another area I need to figure out in WebDriver (not Selenium 2 as Santi so stubbornly referred to it as ðŸ™‚
*   [Janky](https://github.com/github/janky) is GitHubâ€™s CI server. Seems like this is the current cool route; that is, implementing your own rather than building off of one of the major existing ones. Which I suppose makes sense.
*   [From Dependent Tests to Independent Tests to Independent Assertions](http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2011/12/20/from-dependent-tests-to-independent-tests-to-independent-assertions/) has a nice refactoring trick to clean-up your scripts
*   Iâ€™ve posted how to inject Sizzle into your WebDriver scripts at least once, and here is another time. [Injecting the Sizzle CSS selector library](http://selenium.polteq.com/injecting-the-sizzle-css-selector-library/)
*   And if Sizzle isnâ€™t your thing, WebDriver Plus has JQuery-esque DOM [Traversing](http://webdriverplus.org/en/latest/traversing.html)
*   [Important notice regarding Java packages in Partner archive](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html) is something to keep in mind if you want to run the Selenium Server on Ubuntu
*   Looks like ShingingPanda is the Python equivalent of CloudBees, and has instructions on how to get Selenium running on it in [ShiningPanda is Selenium ready!](http://blog.shiningpanda.com/2011/11/shiningpanda-is-selenium-ready.html)
*   Articles that lead in with _Boy. That was a headache._ are usually good ones to link to. [WebDriver, Webdriver, and more web driver.](http://shizen008.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/webdriver-webdriver-and-more-web-driver) This one is about the WebDriver iOS driver.

And todayâ€™s post of mine is [WebDriver and Cookies](http://element34.ca/blog/webdriver-and-cookies) which explains how, well, cookies and webdriver play together.
