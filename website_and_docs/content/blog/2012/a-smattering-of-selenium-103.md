Seems I had this all ready to go yesterday… oh, and Happy Birthday Jim Evans — maintainer of IE and C# driver. If also a day late.

*   [Migrating Unit Tests from Selenium to Watir Webdriver](http://www.hiretheworld.com/blog/tech-blog/migrating-unit-tests-from-selenium-to-watir-webdriver) is less about migrating rather than a quick overview of Watir
*   [HttpWatch 8.4: Supports Firefox 14 and Selenium](http://blog.httpwatch.com/2012/07/17/httpwatch-8-4-supports-firefox-14-and-selenium/) appears to be http traffic monitor — minus a proxy

*   [Why I don’t like factory\_girl](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-07-14-why-i-don-t-like-factory_girl) — _This story is one of Ruby groupthink gone awry_
*   [Selenize](http://selenize.tk/) looks like another Se-in-the-cloud, but tightly coupled to Github
