*   If you are not using something like Chef or Puppet to keep your grid nodes behaving then you are absolutely doing it wrong. Here are all the [PuppetConf 2012 Videos](http://puppetlabs.com/community/videos/puppetconf/) to help you get started. See also [this](http://memegenerator.net/instance/27887540)
*   [Apple’s Lightning port dynamically assigns pins to allow for reversible use](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/25/apples_lightning_port_dynamically_assigns_pins_to_allow_for_reversible_use) is just too geeky not to include. Hurray for hardware lock-in?
*   [Websockets 101](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/9/24/websockets-101/) — again, if your app uses a technology, you better be damned clueful about it if you are going to automate it
*   [Child Elements](http://selenium34.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/child-elements/) seems to address the ‘is my element where I expect it’ problem though I’m still not convinced that is a problem that needed solving
*   [HTML for Icon Font Usage](http://css-tricks.com/html-for-icon-font-usage/) could be interesting. Though introduces me to the notion of ‘pseudo elements’, which in addition to ‘shadow dom’ makes me think we may have finally group-think-ed the HTML specs enough.
*   [Increase Virtual Box VDI disk size on MAC or Windows](http://tips.kaali.co.uk/2012/03/16/expand-or-increase-the-size-of-virtual-box-vdi-dis/) — amazing how much faster a vm runs when you give it enough disk to breathe
*   Using ShiningPanda and Django? [Multi-browser Selenium tests with Django 1.4+ on Jenkins](http://www.shiningpanda.com/blog/2012/09/27/multi-browser-selenium-tests-django-14-jenkins/) is for you!
*   I use TextMate, but [How to save/restore Sublime Text 2 configs/plugins to migrate to another computer?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11365948/how-to-save-restore-sublime-text-2-configs-plugins-to-migrate-to-another-compute) could be useful for the even cooler segment of people
*   Font geek enough that you want, no, demand! a specific font for writing code in? Adobe is here to help; [Announcing Source Code Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html)
*   I’m kinda amazed that more people don’t do this; [Calculating the code coverage of integration tests](http://blog.avisi.nl/2012/09/25/calculating-the-code-coverage-of-integration-tests/). Afterall, imaginary numbers FTW!
