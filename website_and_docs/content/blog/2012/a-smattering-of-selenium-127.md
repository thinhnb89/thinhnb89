Within an hour I had some more things to add to the last Smattering. Oh well, I’ll just save them up…

*   [Har-assert](http://roydekleijn.github.com/har-assert/) looks like something useful to include in your project if you are using Java. And the browsermob-proxy (which of course, you all are)
*   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) seems like something more people should care about.
*   Right. Here is another cool part of the nebulous, meaningless thing called HTML5. [Using the PageVisibility API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/pagevisibility/intro/). Anyone want to take bets on how long this gets used for evil rather than awesome?
*   [JUnit 4.11](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes4.11.md) is out. The link is to the release notes. The ‘test execution order’ stuff seems like bowing to pressure rather than good test design…
*   [Why Averages Suck and Percentiles are Great](http://blog.dynatrace.com/2012/11/14/why-averages-suck-and-percentiles-are-great/) is your monthly statistics lesson.
*   Alright, here is the challenge for everyone who wants to get involved in the project but is afraid they cannot code well enough. (If I can code well enough, so can you…) The docs can always use more people! And then we should get !se to work on via [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com).
*   [Test::Page](https://github.com/jarmo/test-page) is another helper for making Page Objects in Ruby
*   The first item in [An impassioned plea to other Start-up founders to use automated tests](http://www.jpuopolo.com/2012/09/an-impassioned-plea-to-other-start-up-founders-to-use-automated-tests/) is the only one that really holds any water. The rest, well, is showing the author’s developer bias I think. (The rest of his blog seems pretty good as well.)
*   [RainbowDriver](https://github.com/rainbowdriver) looks interesting. Though after the flurry around the Mobile Test Summit there seems to be no more commits…
*   [The Shumway Open SWF Runtime Project](https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2012/11/12/introducing-the-shumway-open-swf-runtime-project/) Not sure how I feel about Shumway. On one hand, open is better than closed, but from an automation perspective, SWF is a _pain_
