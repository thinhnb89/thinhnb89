I think everyone is on holidays right now…

*   [Firefox 15 plugs the add-on leaks](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2012/07/19/firefox-15-plugs-the-add-on-leaks/) — Hey look! Openness from Mozilla! I’m not kidding when I say I want to see more of these; from all browser vendors.
*   [JUnit Oath](http://junitoath.caucus.com/) — when geeks collide!
*   [Integration Tests With Cucumber-Jvm, Selenium and Maven](http://www.weblogism.com/item/334/integration-tests-with-cucumber-jvm-selenium-and-maven) is nice in that is shows the use of profiles (which is pretty much maven’s killer feature) but it uses Se-RC. Stop doing that!
*   [Testing your patience ….](http://iainrose.tumblr.com/) – Iain is on a role with 4 Se related posts in a week.
*   [Testing CSV file uploads](http://rubyquicktips.com/post/27753730620/testing-csv-file-uploads) is a RoR recipe
*   [Enforced Randomization](http://www.testinggeek.com/cast-2012-enforced-randomization-increasing-the-value-of-test-automation) is a lightning talk from last week’s CAST conference. I like the definition of the types of randomization
*   [Living with HTTPS](http://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/07/19/hope9talk.html) explains some things you will want to be looking at in your Page Object validate() methods.
*   [Selenium on Fedora 17](http://ilker.de/selenium-on-fedora-17.html) is good once you ignore the first section. Se-Core is not a thing anymore; you don’t need to install it.
*   [Remove the annoying certificate error page when running selenium tests](http://andrewchaa.me.uk/2012/07/19/remove-the-annoying-certificate-error-page-when-running-selenium-tests/) – You know, if you just _**DON’T USE INVALID OR SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES IN YOUR AUTOMATION ENVIRONMENTS**_ then you don’t have this problem.
*   I’m not sure how successful podcasts of programming sessions will be, but [Every Android session from Google I/O 2012 is now available for your listening pleasure via the Android Developers Live podcast!](https://plus.google.com/108967384991768947849/posts/HD3kQcKgtKi). Of course, nothing on TDD, Automation or Testing. As usual. Testing tools being a lagging indicator indeed.
