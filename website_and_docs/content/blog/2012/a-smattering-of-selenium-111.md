When this gets published, Iâ€™ll be sitting around the Barcelona airport waiting for my connection home. Unless I screwed up the time math. ðŸ™‚

*   [The dangers of uniformity](http://agiletesting.blogspot.co.at/2012/08/the-dangers-of-uniformity.html) pours cold water on something that I know I used to preach for automation environments.
*   [How to crawl a quarter billion webpages in 40 hours](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-to-crawl-a-quarter-billion-webpages-in-40-hours/) doesnâ€™t have code listed (he explains why) but it explains how you could write it yourself if you wanted.
*   [No coffee today, a report of the Munich 08/12 test automation code retreat](http://cultivatecode.blogspot.de/2012/08/no-coffee-today-report-of-munich-0812.html) has me thinking that for Se Conf next year, a â€˜test automation code retreatâ€™ might be an interesting thing.
*   [Behat + Selenium2 / Webdriver](http://michaelheap.com/behat-selenium2-webdriver/) is interesting. And has been updated to have a link to [Behat + Selenium2 / Webdriver with MinkExtension](http://michaelheap.com/behat-selenium2-webdriver-with-minkextension/) which apparently is easier.
*   [Bouncing Pythonâ€™s Generators With a Trampoline](http://usrsb.in/blog/blog/2012/08/12/bouncing-pythons-generators-with-a-trampoline/) lost me at â€˜tail call optimizationâ€™ but seems cool.
*   The AA-FTT annual workshop was last weekend, here is an [excellent write-up](http://craigsmith.id.au/2012/08/13/aaftt-workshop-2012-dallas/) about what happened there.
*   [Droplets of Watir](http://markoh.eu/droplets) seems like a great collection of recipes for Watir.
*   [Selenium Best Practices](http://mestachs.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/selenium-best-practices/) is a good page, with a _horrible_ name
*   [Workflow Driven Development: Asserting a Workflow using an Audit Trail](http://randonom.com/blog/2012/08/workflow-driven-development-asserting-a-workflow-using-an-audit-trail/) reminds us that individual page states are not the only thing that matters.
*   [Mozilla drops usage of Selenium RC](http://blargon7.com/2012/08/mozilla-drops-usage-of-selenium-rc/) shows that Mozilla is right on the cutting edge. But also raises the question of when should the rest of us should drop it as well.
