Five days and fifty links laterâ€¦

*   Iâ€™m working on a larger-ish rant on headless browsers, but until then there is [Jasmine Headless WebKit](http://johnbintz.github.com/jasmine-headless-webkit/)
*   Not 2. Not 4. But [Three ways to generate test data for your ruby automated tests](http://watirmelon.com/2012/06/15/three-ways-to-generate-test-data-for-your-ruby-automated-tests/)
*   Downloading things is a pain, but [Waiting for watir-webdriver downloads (and determining the file name)](http://watirmelon.com/2012/06/15/waiting-for-watir-webdriver-downloads-and-determining-the-file-name/) has a solution
*   Use classes in Python? Of course you do! [Under the hood of Python class definitions](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/06/15/under-the-hood-of-python-class-definitions/) â€” but as the warning states, _If the prospect of pondering the metaclass of the metaclass of your class makes you feel nauseated, you better stop now._

*   [WatirSplash](https://github.com/jarmo/watirsplash) is another framework to steal ideas from ðŸ™‚
*   [Python Deployment Anti-Patterns](http://hynek.me/articles/python-deployment-anti-patterns/) likely applies to more than just Python
*   [Donâ€™t Build APIsâ€¦](http://ceklog.kindel.com/2012/04/18/dont-build-apis/) is a nice little rant
*   [ASP.NET MVC + Selenium + IISExpress](http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2011/12/22/asp-net-mvc-selenium-iisexpress.aspx)
*   [Being good at waiting â€“ Using Selenium to test Ajax-intensive pages](http://blog.crisp.se/2012/04/19/alexandertarnowski/slides-from-selenium-conference) from SeConf2012
