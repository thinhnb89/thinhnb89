This was supposed to go out Friday, but the flu bug I picked up decided to move the schedule about somewhat.

*   As Se marches towards being a W3C standard, the sort of thing in [OAuth and API Providers: Come on guys.](http://gist.io/3170829) scares me more and more.
*   [Why WP\_Error Sucks](http://journal.ryanmccue.info/165/why-wp_error-sucks/). Intelligent error handling is hard. Especially when you have a legacy install base to deal with. A nice little rant.
*   Normally you see lists from people about books individuals want to see written, but Heroku has gone one step further and has released [Contribute a Dev Center Article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/open-topics) of articles they want to see written about how to use their stuff. Brilliant?
*   Issue 141 is getting some publicity this week featuring prominantly in a talk I’ve given 3 times in the last two weeks and now Jim answers once and for all the question of [WebDriver: Y U NO HAVE HTTP Status Codes?!](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/07/webdriver-y-u-no-have-http-status-codes.html). Who am I kidding? There is no way this goes away. _USE A PROXY!_
*   [find a valid and unused port to listen on](http://paste.ubuntu.com/1111807/) is a nice little shell script that does exactly what it says. Was posted in the context of finding a port for grid nodes to listen to iirc
*   [How To Download Files With Selenium And Why You Shouldn’t](http://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-download-files-with-selenium-and-why-you-shouldnt/) echos a lot of what I say around scripting downloads. Also notice the bit at the end about checking status codes if you have an unnatural phobia of proxies
*   [BIDPOM drops support for Selenium RC](http://blargon7.com/2012/07/bidpom-drops-support-for-selenium-rc/) I think is the first project I have seen come out and explicitly drop support for Se-RC. I expect to see more of this over the next year.
*   I haven’t gone through it yet, but it looks like I need to pick up some Objective-C skillz soon and [About Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) looks pretty good from the quick skim I did.
*   I converted to OSX partly because it was FreeBSD way, way, _way_ under the hood. [Mac 10.7 $PATH Settings And Environment Variables](http://www.semioticpixels.com/crib-notes/mac-10-7-path-settings-and-environment-variables/) really shows how divergent things have come. But is something you need to know when building slave machines
*   Speaking of Mountain Lion, [Interesting new UNIX commands/binaries in OS X Mountain Lion](http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/07/interesting-new-unix-commandsbinaries-in-os-x-mountain-lion/). Something about calling a utility that keeps the machine from going to sleep ‘caffeinate’ cracks me up.
