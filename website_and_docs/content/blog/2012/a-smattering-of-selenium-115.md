*   The big news in the twitter-verse yesterday was the announcement of [Apple Sauce and Android Sauce](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/08/apple-sauce-android-sauce/) from Sauce Labs. I of course jumped all over that bandwagon with [Apple Sauce and Android Sauce .. Yummy! (And Fully Supported)](http://element34.ca/blog/apple-sauce-and-android-sauce-yummy-and-fully-supported)
[](http://element34.ca/blog/apple-sauce-and-android-sauce-yummy-and-fully-supported)*   [](http://element34.ca/blog/apple-sauce-and-android-sauce-yummy-and-fully-supported)[Accessing priviledged Javascript APIs from your web page in Firefox with Selenium](http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/08/22/accessing-priviledged-javascript-apis-from-your-web-page-in-firefox-with-selenium) lets to pull even more strings of the browser than you were supposed to be able to. Something I suspect Marionette will make redundant, but until then…
*   [Use Xvfb, Selenium and Chrome to drive a web browser in PHP](http://www.yann.com/en/use-xvfb-selenium-and-chrome-to-drive-a-web-browser-in-php-23/08/2012.html) starts with the same-old, same-old, but scroll down to the bottom for squid and iptables and other things
*   [Integrating Selenium with ALM – a simple recipe](http://testingfroth.blogspot.ca/2012/08/integrating-selenium-with-alm-simple.html) shows how to do it, but I still say whomever packages this up really well will make a lot of money
*   [You Papers Please](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/8/your-papers-please) is something that will start to come up in the Se community soon-ish I fear.
*   [Emulator Networking](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#emulatornetworking) is a link I wish I had before spending an hour or so trying to search SO etc. for it
*   [The Axis of Eval](http://axisofeval.blogspot.co.at/search/label/thispltlife) is just funny
*   [BrowsermobRESTclient](https://github.com/roydekleijn/BrowsermobRESTclient) is a Java client for the BrowserMob Proxy
*   [My Shallow Dive into iOS automation](http://whotestedthis.squarespace.com/journal/2012/8/28/my-shallow-dive-into-ios-automation.html) looks at the various options out there for native automation
*   Py.Test is awesome. And makes my brain hurt.
