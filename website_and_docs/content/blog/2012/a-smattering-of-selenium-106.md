In case you are curious, the train just went past my old neighbourhood.

*   [Marionette – The Future of FirefoxDriver in Selenium](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2012/marionette-the-future-of-firefoxdriver-in-selenium.html) is a project that has been hinted at here before I think, but this is its coming out party. Oh. And its the future of the Firefox driver. Now, what I need is an A-Team t-shirt…
*   [FlynnID 0.2](http://blargon7.com/2012/07/flynnid-0-2/) changes its config format. I don’t play around with Grid much (at all) but I’ve been told that you need this if you are going to have Android devicii attached to the grid.
*   [Geb: Groovy Browser Automation Tool – Part 2](http://xebee.xebia.in/2012/07/24/geb-groovy-browser-automation-tool-–-part-2/) starts out with a Page Object which is becoming the minimum standard for tutorial-esque posts
*   [Proxy & Executor](http://element34.ca/blog/proxy-executor) is the meetup talk I did at SFSe, SJSe and YYZSe over the span of 10 days this month. Slides, multiple video, notes, etc.
*   [Hiss](http://collect3.com.au/hiss/) routes Growl messages through Mountain Lion’s Notification Center. I keep thinking I should use Growl for more things with my frameworks…
*   [Cucumber & Cheese](https://leanpub.com/cucumber_and_cheese) is not just about Ruby and Page Objects but how everything fits into the whole ATDD thing. Is likely Watir focused, but there are few people I would trust with this content more than Jeff.
*   [Gargoyle](https://github.com/disqus/gargoyle/) is feature switching for Django.
*   [Automate the install of JDK 5 on Lion and Mountain Lion](https://gist.github.com/1163008) seems like something that should be configured via Puppet or Chef or similar, but is geeky enough to include anyways.
*   [Garzik: An Andre To Remember](http://lwn.net/Articles/508467/) is not Se related, but is important for people to read and remember to have context. And to remember there is a whole world outside.
*   [Python For Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/u/kennethreitz/p/python-for-humans) is awesome. I’d like the whole ‘… For Humans’ thing to catch on.
