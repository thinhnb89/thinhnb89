`# sudo wget coffee > adam`

*   [Selenium-RC Commands](http://compendiumdev.co.uk/selenium/mindmap/Selenium-RC_Commands.html) is a mindmap of all the commands in Se-RC. (Unsurprising really.) I keep meaning to do this for WebDriver.
*   [quacken](https://bitbucket.org/DanC/quacken/overview) is a script for grabbing OFX files from Quicken it seems
*   What’s that? You weren’t happy with one of the six PHP WebDriver clients that were out there already? Have another one — [Nearsoft/PHP-SeleniumClient](https://github.com/Nearsoft/PHP-SeleniumClient). It’d be spooky what would happen if we all got together on this.
*   [Thucydides Release 0.8.26](http://thucydides-webtests.com/2012/06/24/thucydides-release-0-8-26-support-for-selenium-remote-web-driver-and-spring-dependencies/) grew Remote WebDriver support (and something to do with Spring but I don’t speak Java)
*   I don’t know if this is a chop or not, but

    is hilarious. Well, from a ‘been there, done that, crap I forgot to revert’ perspective.
    
*   Yes, packaging is a hard problem. No, I don’t know how to even begin to solve it. [Python Packaging: Hate, hate, hate everywhere](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/6/22/hate-hate-hate-everywhere/) is kinda a history lesson on what the current state of the world is in Python.
*   Oh, and because this is what happens on the internets, there is a bigger discussion of the previous article over on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4147368)
*   [inproctester](https://github.com/aharin/inproctester) is a standalone J2EE app server for running HTMLUnit WebDriver scripts
*   Its a bit amusing \[though not to a lot of people\] how much love parts of WebDriver get from the world at large and how much hatred other parts get. [What’s Wrong With the Internet Explorer Driver?](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html) enumerates some of the causes, why they got that way, and throws down the gauntlet to Microsoft. Who will promptly do, erm, nothing…
*   [Accept-Charset Is No More](http://hsivonen.iki.fi/accept-charset/) seems like one of those browser differences that we should know about.
