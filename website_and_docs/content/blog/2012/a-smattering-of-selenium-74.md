*   [Testing Facebook Login with Selenium](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2012/01/testing-facebook-login-with-selenium.html) has some nice Python helpers to dealing with Facebook auth
*   [VBS WebDriver](http://htejera.users.sourceforge.net/vbswebdriver/index.html) – ummm, wtf?!
*   [Python Browsermob Proxy Library](http://oss.theautomatedtester.co.uk/browsermob-proxy-py/) – the best code is code you don’t have to write yourself. (Thanks David!)
*   I saw [A Few of My Favorite (Python) Things](http://mike.pirnat.com/2012/01/13/a-few-of-my-favorite-python-things/) at CodeMash last week and learned a few things
*   [def test = new BDDMadeEasy(Selenium,EasyB,Groovy)](http://www.rajivnarula.com/blog/2012/01/12/def-test-new-bddmadeeasyseleniumeasybgroovy/) is a writeup from a recent presenter at the Greater Boston Selenium User Group

*   [Case Study: Building the Stanisław Lem Google doodle](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/lem) is interesting. And likely useful for others doing JS heavy stuff
*   [A neater way to use reflection in Java](http://java.dzone.com/articles/neater-way-use-reflection-java) seems trick to me. Or might be utter hackery to someone who actually knows Java
*   [The beginning of a standard for browser automation](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2012/the-beginning-of-a-standard-for-browser-automation.html) makes me have [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0FBi5Rv1ho) in my head
