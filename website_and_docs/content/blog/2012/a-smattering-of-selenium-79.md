The only links left now are ones currently open in tabs right now. Hurray!

*   November’s SFSE was Continuous Deployment At Mozilla: [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/MattBrandt/mozilla-continuous-deploment-on-sumo), [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usqxFxsmg4o&feature=youtu.be)
*   [Practical Web Test Automation](http://zhimin.com/en/books/pwta) is a book available in both a free and paid editions. I haven’t looked at it so can’t comment how good or bad it is.
*   [The Why, What and How of Software Test Automation](http://www.toolsjournal.com/testing-articles/item/340-the-why-what-and-how-of-software-test-automation) isn’t too horrible, though I don’t like the word ‘guideline’ and of course the measurement section at the bottom is complete hokum.
*   [Internet Explorer for Mac the Easy Way: Run IE 7, IE8, & IE9 Free in a Virtual Machine](http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/) seems a bit sketchy in terms of license legality, but…
*   [PageMapper](https://bitbucket.org/frennky/pagemapper) is a bit of template magic to create Page Objects
*   [Web Consistency Testing](http://webconsistencytesting.com/) is starting to push what can \[should\] be done with Selenium
*   [Taking Automated Tests Off The Pedestal](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104920553571646483561/posts/fmyZi1MxMgo) erm, takes automation off its pedestal
*   [Monkey-Patching iOS with Objective-C Categories Part I: Simple Extensions and Overrides](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2012/01/23/monkey-patching-ios-with-objective-c-categories-part-1-simple-extensions-and-overrides/) is a technique I haven’t seen before.
*   [A Tool’s Tale](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/919-A-Tools-Tale.html) would be better with Sebastian in front of it, but is still useful as a standalone deck.
*   [Introducing the software testing ice-cream cone](http://watirmelon.com/2012/01/31/introducing-the-software-testing-ice-cream-cone/) – Dangit! Now I want ice cream.

And my post this edition is [WebDriver and Meta Tags](http://element34.ca/blog/webdriver-and-meta-tags).
