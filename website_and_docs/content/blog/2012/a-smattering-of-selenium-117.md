  Evolutionary Project Structure talks about a particular project structure...
---
*   [Evolutionary Project Structure](http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/08/30/evolutionary-project-structure/) talks about a particular project structure, but this is one of those fun developer opinionated things to geek out on
*   [Testers Caught Sleeping on the Job](http://experttesters.com/2012/08/13/testers-caught-sleeping-on-the-job) is not browser-based, but you cannot bash sleeps enough. Also has a pretty amusing photo with it
*   [PHP: The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) is of course one person’s understanding of the ‘right way’ but still not bad.
*   Automation is Code. But are [your code conventions hurting you](http://www.carlopescio.com/2011/04/your-coding-conventions-are-hurting-you.html)?
*   Hate Eclipse for writing your scripts in? [JetBrains has specials](http://www.jetbrains.com/specials/index.jsp). I’ve only seen PyCharm, but it looked pretty nice.
*   Has anyone tried manipulating tabs with WebDriver the way that is described in [Closing Tabs in Chrome](http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/blog/12-09-04/closing-tabs-in-chrome.aspx)
*   I haven’t watched it, but Moodle is now doing a series of videos on how they do automation.

*   Want to hear Simon rant about how to [Stop the rot: Banishing Flakiness from Selenium Tests with Simon Stewart](https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/519621639)? What are you waiting for then? Register already. Sheesh.
*   The W3C has github-ified the [html spec](https://github.com/w3c/html)
*   Looks like the [Se Plugin for Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Selenium+Plugin) has been re-written. Might be worth a look again.
