<Insert witty/snarky commentary on something here>

*   Apparently the TestWatchman thing I linked to is deprecated now in favour of TestWatcher (shows how much I pay attention to JUnit stuffâ€¦). [Here is an example of TestWatchers and RuleChains](http://blog.zvestov.cz/item/98/catid/16). No, I donâ€™t know what the blurb at the top says.
*   Sure, weâ€™ve all see lorum ipsum text, but do you know what it (ish) says? [now you do](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)
*   From the â€˜MEASURE ALL THINGS!!!â€™ category is Mozillaâ€™s [BuildFaster](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/BuildFaster). There was a cool graph of build times I saw somewhere tooâ€¦

*   There seems to be lots of good stuff on [Darrell Graingerâ€™s blog](http://darrellgrainger.blogspot.ca)
*   [An Analysis of the Top Python Repositories Hosted on Github](http://mjp.github.com/2012/08/29/github-python-analysis.html) is interesting. I have no idea how to apply this to Se, but stillâ€¦
*   Read [Naming From the Outside In](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/naming-from-the-outside-in/464270190272517) before writing another line of code in a page object
