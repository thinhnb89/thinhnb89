As youâ€™ll start to see by the timestamps of things towards the end, Iâ€™m running out of â€˜newâ€™ stuff and am pulling from the queue now.

*   Fairly certain Iâ€™ve linked to this before, but [seleniumwrapper](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/seleniumwrapper/0.3.4) adds some syntacitcal sugar around the Python bindings. Though not sure that it makes it clearer to me.
*   [What the heck is an xrange?](http://late.am/post/2012/06/18/what-the-heck-is-an-xrange) is todayâ€™s Python internal geekiness post
*   [Functional Automated Testing Best Practices with Selenium WebDriver](http://vimeo.com/44133409) is the video version of [these slides](http://benburton.github.com/presentations/webdriver-best-practices/) (wow I dislike this html slide deck trendâ€¦)
*   All the [WWDC 2012 Session Videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/) are now up. Naturally there is nothing on automation or testing, but its not like app developers do any of that stuff anyways ðŸ™‚
*   All the [Slides and Videos](https://github.com/watir/watir-bazaar/wiki/Presentations) from this yearâ€™s Watir Bazaar (which is likely more valuable than the WWDC stuffâ€¦)
*   [Avoiding Brittle Automation](http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/blog/jimholmes/12-03-28/avoiding-brittle-automation.aspx) is a lightning-ish talk from STPCon in New Orleans back in March
*   [Using a Headless Browser in .Net](http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/selenium-webdriver---using-a-headless-browser-in--net/69) might be the first article Iâ€™ve seen on this for .NET. Iâ€™m officially ignoring them in Pythonâ€¦
*   [Cucumber-Crash-Course](https://github.com/tourdedave/Cucumber-Crash-Course) is healdless cucumber/capybara. Getting close to ignoring Ruby headless too.
*   [The Robots are Taking Over](http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=437) â€“ reading between the lines, if you are automating the fun stuff you are doing it wrong.
*   [Automated Deployment of PHP Applications using git](http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/03/automated-deployment-of-wordpress-using-git/) looks generic enough. You always have to watch that people actually mean â€˜gitâ€™ and not â€˜git as implemented by the kids at githubâ€™
