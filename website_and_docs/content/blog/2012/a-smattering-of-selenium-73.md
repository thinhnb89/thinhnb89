  Two Ruby gems...
---

*   Two Ruby gems
    *   [rwebspec-webdriver](http://rubygems.org/gems/rwebspec-webdriver) – Executable functional specification for web applications in RSpec syntax and Selenium-WebDriver
    *   [loadable\_component](http://rubygems.org/gems/loadable_component) – Ruby implementation of [LoadableComponent](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/LoadableComponent)
*   A three-parter on building a framework showing there is more than one way to skin the framework cat.
    
    *   [Testing Concepts](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/selenium-testing-framework-pt-1-testing-concepts/)
    *   [Base Classes](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/selenium-testing-framework-pt-2-base-classes/)
    *   [Putting it all together](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/12/selenium-testing-framework-part-3-putting-it-all-together/)
*   Another three-parter on _Is the Cost of Continuous Integration Worth the Value on Your Program?_ – [part 1](http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/12/is-the-cost-of-continuous-integration-worth-the-value-on-your-program-part-1.html), [part 2](http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/12/is-the-cost-of-continuous-integration-worth-the-value-on-your-program-part-2.html), [part 3](http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/12/is-the-cost-of-continuous-integration-worth-the-value-on-your-program-part-3.html)
*   [31 Days of Testing](http://frazzleddad.blogspot.com/2011/12/31-days-of-testing-kickoff.html) – in 23 parts (though I expect the series will finish after [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org))
*   [The secret history of “about:jwz”, “about:mozilla” and the Netscape Throbbers](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/12/the-secret-history-of-aboutjwz-aboutmozilla-and-the-netscape-throbbers/) is just a fun browser history read
*   [Pulling Jenkins’ strings with Puppet](http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/12/28/jenkins-with-puppet.html) looks like a way of managing Jenkins instances through puppet — which is darn cool.
*   [Given When Then](http://mulabs.io/givenwhenthen) is a BDD tool for Node.js which does its post-conversion-magic runs using WebDriver (please stop calling it Selenium 2!) and Sauce Labs
*   [Selenium Utility Funcs](https://gist.github.com/1411564) is a list of python helpers (with slightly friendlier names) for WebDriver
*   [Converting Gems](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/ConvertingGems) shows a neat trick for converting ruby gems into .deb files so they can be installed and managed via apt
*   Since we all care about the web, [Move the Web Forward](http://movethewebforward.org/) – _You love web standards. You want to give back to the community. Curious about where to start?_
