Post ten links, find seven more to add to the queue.

*   [Selenium Page Objects and Abstraction](http://www.devguli.com/blog/eng/selenium-page-objects-and-abstraction/) is one person’s attempt at writing down how they describe POs
*   [Running Geb specs using a separate driver profile to test mobile views in Grails](http://fbflex.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/running-geb-specs-using-a-separate-driver-profile-to-test-mobile-views-in-grails/) shows how to create a custom Firefox profile in WebDriver
*   [Django and Selenium on Jenkins/Hudson (Headless)](http://www.xairon.net/2012/01/django-and-selenium-on-jenkinshudson-headless/) is yet another tutorial around xvfb but has a trick at the end I don’t think I’ve seen
*   [Python’s concurrent.futures](http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2012/01/19/concurrent.futures.html) is today’s analysis of building a script
*   [Browser Sedimentation](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/01/22/Confusing-Browser) has an outstanding diagram of whats what in a browser. I know I’ll be referring back to it.
*   [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io/pages/home) seems like it would be useful — especially once you start parallelizing execution across instances
*   [Whole-team Test Automation: Making the Move](http://test.techwell.com/comment/reply/119241) _offers some tips for implementing it on your team_ — at least according to the blurb at the top
*   Hey look! _Another_ xvfb think. Can we please just put this into the Se docs already?  
    {{< youtube DL7gyuqkzzU >}}
*   [Selenium Webdriver, Perl, and Saucelabs](http://danzorx.tumblr.com/post/15330968896/selenium-webdriver-perl-and-saucelabs) also acts as a sample for the (a) Perl WebDriver binding too
*   [Convincing management that cooperation and collaboration was worth it](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/01/05/convincing-management-that-cooperation-and-collaboration-was-worth-it/) – dark launches, config flags, oh my.
