Back on the train again. Wow, the highway is screwed today.

*   [The Automation Litmus Test](http://element34.ca/blog/the-automation-litmus-test) is one that most companies face, but now it has a name
*   Okay, who has more info on the bots mentioned in [Meet the ‘bots’ that edit Wikipedia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18892510)? Highly doubt that they are Se powered, but it is a fun mental image
*   [Custom PHPUnit Annotations](http://blog.behance.net/dev/custom-phpunit-annotations) is useful magic if you are building out a framework
*   I’ve linked to things before about where to put things and how to find them, and [purpose-oriented tests](http://searls.testdouble.com/2012/07/27/purpose-oriented-tests/) continues that trend
*   [Moving Towards a Continuous Integration and Deployment Process](http://www.instigatorblog.com/continuous-integration-deployment-process/2012/07/26/) is a nice explanation of how one team does Continuous Delivery. Notice how they use \[human\] testers.
*   The PageFactory is magic. And magic is not always good. As Iain found out..
    
    *   [Using By objects to verify if WebElement present](http://iainrose.tumblr.com/post/28060274976/using-by-objects-to-verify-if-webelement-present)
    *   [Using By objects to locate WebElements inside other WebElements](http://iainrose.tumblr.com/post/28062632544/using-by-objects-to-locate-webelements-inside-other)
    *   [Using By objects in canned WebDriverWait ExpectedCondition](http://iainrose.tumblr.com/post/28063563579/using-by-objects-in-canned-webdriverwait)
    
    Now, if someone wants to solve these problems using PageFactory and then update the wiki page…
    
*   The [Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy) has been unleashed! (Also know as the Netflix Chaos Monkey)
*   [Rants of a Madman – I don’t care if it’s automation, it’s still code!](http://markslawler.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/rants-of-a-madman-i-dont-care-if-its-automation-its-still-code/) is full of the ironies that testers inflict upon themselves and their teams
*   [Capturing Performance Data from Selenium Tests](http://hello.neustar.biz/neustar-meetup-july-2012-thankyouv4.html) is a recording from the July San Diego Web Performance Meetup
*   [I used to believe in the tooth fairy](http://watirmelon.com/2012/07/31/i-used-to-believe-in-the-tooth-fairy/) is a nice reminder to be open to changing your mind.
