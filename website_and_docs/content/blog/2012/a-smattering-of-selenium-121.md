Its the ‘all github’ edition today!

*   Dave goes a little strange on us with his [diy\_framework](https://github.com/tourdedave/diy_framework) as an _emoting robot_. Here is [the deck](http://www.slideshare.net/tourdedave/selenium-basics/2) that went along with it.
*   Can’t get enough of the food-based frameworks from the kids at Sauce. If you are using the PHPUnit included WebDriver bindings \[and Sauce OnDemand\] then [Sausage](https://github.com/jlipps/sausage) could be of interest.
*   Of course, if you are just using PHPUnit, then [paraunit](https://github.com/jlipps/paraunit) could of interest. I’ve written similar before, but this looks cross-platform.
*   [buster-selenium](https://github.com/plone/buster-selenium) is, erm, well, Selenium for buster.js
*   Why did I only learn about [ievms](https://github.com/xdissent/ievms) now? Oh. Well, one of the requirements is patience. That explains it.
*   [gifsockets](https://github.com/videlalvaro/gifsockets); I’ll wait while you pick up the pieces of your exploded brain
*   [How to capture a FF profile log](https://gist.github.com/3725732). Dunno what gets put in it, but tuck this away in your back pocket
*   I don’t have a use case for [flower](https://github.com/benoitc/flower) but _collection of modules to build distributed and reliable concurrent systems in Python_ seems link-worthy
*   Again, not sure when you would use it, but [webdriver-user-agent-randomizer](https://github.com/asconix/webdriver-user-agent-randomizer) seems darn cool
*   You don’t see too many open-source ios apps, so here is [GoogleTransit-iOS6](https://github.com/simonmaddox/GoogleTransit-iOS6)
