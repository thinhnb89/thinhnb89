Hurray for having fillings done on both sides of my face. Don’t expect me to speak without drolling for rest of the day.

*   I’ll admit to not knowing what the difference is/was between FluentWait and WebDriverWait, but [FluentWait with WebElement](http://seleniumsimplified.com/?p=340) explains it well. With sample code!
*   [PHPUnit + Selenium + php-webdriver = hours of entertainment (Part 1)](http://www.digbymarksit.com/2012/08/18/phpunit-selenium-php-webdriver-hours-of-entertainment-part-1/) shows a nice extension to PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase. Now if only he was using my [active fork](https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver) of the php-webdriver bindings rather than the original project Facebook seems to have abandoned.
*   Speaking of Facebook, [Under the hood: Rebuilding Facebook for iOS](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-rebuilding-facebook-for-ios/10151036091753920) is going to be oft cited in the whole ‘html5 or native’ discussions for the next while I think
*   Santi spoke at the recent San Jose Selenium Meetup; [video](https://my.adobeconnect.com/p3xgh7qcvdn?launcher=false&fcsContent=true&pbMode=normal), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bayh58Xhz8eBjxZvYZoxfvYcWnC9fiAP-h7LklLxGjo/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p)
*   **[On Failure and Resilience](http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/on-failure-and-resilience "On Failure and Resilience")** from **[Mike Brittain](http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain)**
    
*   [Automatic Conditional Retina Images](http://shauninman.com/tmp/retina/) seems like something we should know how to check if its being loaded properly or not. Guess I need to go buy an iPad to check this out…
*   Puppet Labs updated some of their documentation recently; [Puppet 2.7 Reference Manual](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/), [Factor 1.6 Core Facts](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/1.6/core_facts.html)
*   Reddit opensourced [push](https://github.com/reddit/push) which is yet another deployment tool. Remember though, you are likely not Reddit.
*   Hey lookit! The WhiteHouse [uses Selenium](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petition/tree/7.x-1.x/selenium). Though the scripts are Selenese. And named .php for some unknown reason. Actually, they look a lot like they were created as part of some sort of scaffolding. Anyone?
*   Not sure what to do with it, but [Updated List Of Vendors In The Content Delivery and Transparent Caching Markets](http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2012/08/updated-list-of-vendors-in-the-content-delivery-and-transparent-caching-markets.html) looks rather useful. Or not.
