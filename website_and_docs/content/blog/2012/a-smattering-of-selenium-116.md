So do people celebrate the day after Labor day as the beginning of summer?

*   [Web Performance Power Tool: HTTP Archive (HAR)](http://www.igvita.com/2012/08/28/web-performance-power-tool-http-archive-har/) is worrisome that HARs are being billed as a power tool, but full of good stuff
*   [How do you pick responsive images breakpoints?](http://blog.cloudfour.com/how-do-you-pick-responsive-images-breakpoints/) is another one of those problems I think we’re going to have to worry about
*   [TestWatchman](http://kentbeck.github.com/junit/javadoc/latest/org/junit/rules/TestWatchman.html) seems like an interesting bit of JUnit4. (At what point do we have to stop saying 3 or 4 when referring to JUnit?)
*   I’ve been headhunted by Google for years now, [Test Mercenaries](http://mike-bland.com/2012/07/10/test-mercenaries.html) is the one team that would have made me leap.

*   [Robot Framework – Windows Installation The Easy Way](http://case.kapsi.fi/blog/?p=185) is the easy way to install RF on Windows. Shocking, I know.
*   [Amateurs Study Tactics. Professionals Study Logistics](http://www.singlefounder.com/2012/08/28/amateurs-study-tactics-professionals-study-logistics/) seems to resonate with me in how a lot of people approach automation.
*   [Weekly “Ask an Expert” Q&A sessions for Test Automation](http://www.hskupin.info/2012/08/29/weekly-ask-an-expert-qa-sessions-for-test-automation/) with the Mozilla ‘A-Team’
