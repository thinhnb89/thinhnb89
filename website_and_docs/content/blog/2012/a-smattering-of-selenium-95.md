Ok twitterverse. After 2 weeks of very few links a day you explode.

*   [Testing JSF with Arquillian and Selenium](http://www.slideshare.net/lfryc/testing-jsf-with-arquillian-and-selenium) apparently will save the world.
*   [GhostDriver: almost 50%](http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2012/06/26/GhostDriver-almost-50) is an update on something that got a bit of momentum at SeConf2012
*   [Building and profiling high performance systems with Iago](http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/06/building-and-profiling-high-performance.html) is getting a bump by being released at/during Velocity. Not browser based, but what its being used for doesn’t need browsers.
*   [Testing geolocation with capybara + selenium + firefox](http://grosser.it/2012/04/19/testing-geolocation-with-capybara-selenium-firefox/) is an interesting trick to address something I haven’t thought of needing yet.
*   [Run your Selenium tests in the cloud with TestingBot](http://selenium.polteq.com/en/run-your-selenium-tests-in-the-cloud-with-testingbot/) kinda looks like astroturfing but illustrates how to use TestingBot with Java.
*   [Taming the Mobile Beast](http://www.slideshare.net/patrickmeenan/velocity-2012-taming-the-mobile-beast) is a deck \[also from Velocity I think\]
*   [Netflix open sources Asgard cloud deployment smarts](http://gigaom.com/cloud/netflix-open-sources-asgard-cloud-deployment-smarts/) is more fun stuff from Netflix
*   [django-skel](http://docs.django-skel.org/en/latest/index.html) solves part of the ‘how do I start a new project’ problem with Django
*   While the BrowserMob Proxy is kinda the default proxy for Selenium, [Debugging with Fiddler](http://fiddler2.com/book/) explains a proxy that is getting more commonplace in the manual testing world.
*   [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/) has the same root word but is very different. Though I am not really sure how wise it is to let a web app construct your schema. Magic rarely results in days that don’t end in tears.
