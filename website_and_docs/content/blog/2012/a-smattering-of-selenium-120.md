  Here we grow again.

*   [Here we grow again. Telerik acquires Fiddler. What’s next?](http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/blog/christophereyhorn/12-09-10/here-we-grow-again-telerik-acquires-fiddler-what-s-next.aspx). So. When can we look for nice Se integration with Fiddler then?
*   [Third-Party Issues and the Performance Ripple Effect](http://blog.dynatrace.com/2012/09/12/third-party-issues-and-the-performance-ripple-effect/) is interesting, and something I’ve harped on consistently.
*   [Automated Web Testing with Selenium](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/selenium) is 3.5 hours of videos on Se. That has my usual complaints; shouldn’t have Se-IDE, there is no such thing as ‘basic’ and ‘advanced’, etc. But its there.
*   [The Oracle Problem and the Teaching of Software Testing](http://kaner.com/?p=190) is long, but important to understand when doing automation. And its sad how many people _don’t_ know this but automate anyways.
*   Sure. A week after I write a web server for PHP to use in php-webdriver’s test suite I see this; [PHP: Built-in web server](http://bigweek.co/2012/9/11/php-built-in-web-server). Welcome indeed.
*   [I want to start a company right out of school!](http://muledesign.com/2012/09/i-want-to-start-a-company-right-out-of-school/) is for designers, but applies just as much to programming/automation.
*   This [online markdown editor](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/werner.robitza/markdown/) is awesome.
*   [Sauce Breakpoints](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/09/using-sauce-breakpoints-to-find-and-fix-flakey-tests/) seems like an interesting hack
*   Since your scripts are _just_ programs, they can call other programs. With python you can now do that with [sh](http://amoffat.github.com/sh/index.html) instead of subprocess (which always boggles me for some reason)
*   [Using a business readable language for browser automation](http://gabrielprioli.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/using-a-business-readable-language-for-browser-automation/) talks about using a cucumber clone with haskell. The mind is blown.
