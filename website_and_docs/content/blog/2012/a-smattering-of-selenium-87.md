Avoiding punching things about software packaging by doing the 4th!!!! smattering in row.

*   [Python Decorators](http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/python-decorators/) is an attempt at picking up a stick the right way
*   A [lawnchair](http://brian.io/lawnchair/) is sorta like a couch except smaller and outside. And a persistence solution for HTML5 apps. If your apps persist data, checking them in the browser is. Not. Enough.
*   Atlassian is building a performance tool off of WebDriver _including Page Objects_ called [soke](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/06/performance-and-soke/)
*   I wonder if we should fail scripts that use vendor prefixes…[How to Unprefix -Webkit-Device-Pixel-Ratio](http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2012/06/14/unprefix-webkit-device-pixel-ratio/)

*   [Repository Structure and Python](http://kennethreitz.com/repository-structure-and-python.html) is full of opinions, but that’s ok, opinions are good.
*   [Skewer](http://www.build-doctor.com/2012/04/23/skewer/) – is _a tool for provisioning cloud nodes with Puppet_. Which is how you should be making sure your bits are on the server. (Or Chef, or CfEngine, or…)
*   [Calabash-Android](http://www.dary.de/2012/04/calabash-android) is I think the ‘new’ way of driving Android apps. It keep changing…
