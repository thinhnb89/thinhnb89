Good news, everybody! [Selenium Conf ’12](http://www.seleniumconf.org/) is getting closer! We recently [selected the speakers](http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/) for the conference, and it’s going to be a great mix of talks, spanning the full range of subjects from the very practical to the deeply technical. I’m promised that there will be robots.

Selenium Conf isn’t just about the planned talks, it’s also about the community. On the final day, there will be an unconference, so if there’s something you feel passionately about and feel the world should know, now’s your chance. You’ll not only have a chance to talk to and meet other selenium users, but also many of the core team members.

The conference runs from the 16-18 April in London. [Tickets are still available](http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/)! We’re looking forward to seeing you there.
