Dear body; what time zone are you in?

Ah well, until that battle resolves itself, here are some links.

*   [Firefox the Clear Winner for Automated Testing](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/08/firefox-the-clear-winner-for-automated-testing/) has a wonderfully SEO friendly title, but really is just some cool usage graphs for their system. Extrapolate beyond that at your own risk.
*   [Task Automation FTW!](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/29058868277/task-automation-ftw) â€” make your application installable! I did something like this a decade ago (also using python) but finding something in my own blog seems a harder challenge than it should be.
*   [Running SauceLabs Selenium test suite locally with PHPUnit](http://julianhigman.com/blog/2012/08/09/running-saucelabs-selenium-test-suite-locally-with-phpunit) explains how to solve my number one complains for the various BaaS vendor plugins.
*   And TextMate is [now Open Source](https://github.com/textmate/textmate), ya! Under GPL3. Ohâ€¦
*   I donâ€™t know what IFTTT is, or how to see the actual script \[without joining\], but [Capture all Smatterings of Selenium entries to Evernote](http://ifttt.com/recipes/48831) might be of interest to people. If a bit meta to be linking to it.
*   So Patrick Lightbody isnâ€™t at Neustar (which bought Browsermob) any more (congrats on the new gig at New Relic btw!) so I was a bit worried about what was going to happen with the BrowserMob Proxy. Seems the GitHub effect has happened once more and there are others also [Tweaking BrowserMob-Proxy](http://blog.stuartherbert.com/php/2012/08/10/tweaking-browsermob-proxy/).
*   As is the case with similar articles to [Things I didnâ€™t know about the WebKit inspector](http://blog.joocode.com/browsers/12-things-about-the-webkit-inspector-i-didnt-know/), read the comments for more things you likely didnâ€™t know.
*   [Feature Flags in JavaScript](http://blog.thepete.net/blog/2012/05/09/javascript-feature-flags/) â€“ do this!
*   [Managing browsers from the command line on OS X](http://scottcsims.com/wordpress/?p=382) is a bit of shell trickery Iâ€™d ashamed to admit I didnâ€™t know. Well, the _open_ bit at any rate.
*   [Code First API Library, Scaffolding & Guidance for Coded UI Tests](http://codeduicodefirst.codeplex.com) seems very WebDriver-esque in how to do things. Go Team! ðŸ˜‰
