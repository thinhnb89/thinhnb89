And home. Which mean 100% more internets! Or at least 98% more.

*   As things like native-driver become more prevalent, knowing how to do [Continuous Integration for iOS projects with Jenkins CI](http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2012/01/continuous-integration-for-ios-projects-with-jenkins-ci/) will become more important
*   [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) seems like a nice and big step towards managing Windows build slaves
*   SST (Selenium Simple Test) comes out of Ubuntu and has a quick introductory screencast.  
    {{< youtube qGPostUOAEI >}}
*   [Automate Salesforce Config Changes with Selenium](http://www.cloudspokes.com/challenges/1353) is a contest. But only for Java so I have no interest in it. Submissions are due in two days. Could be fun.
*   [cssify](http://cssify.appspot.com/) is a great little app for converting xpath to css. Now to see what sorts of devious xpath we can put in and blow Santiâ€™s mind with bug reports. ðŸ™‚
*   [Continuous Delivery with Bamboo Stages](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/01/continuous-delivery-with-bamboo-stages/) â€“ I normally call these â€˜chainsâ€™ but nicely shows how to chunk the march to production. It also cracks me up that the corporate twitter feed has [the upgraded beer cart](http://twitter.com/#!/brittpwalker/status/160520765832314881/photo/1) photo in the sidebar right now.
*   One talk I skipped at Codemash the other week was on Appleâ€™s [UI Automation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/UIAutomationRef/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009771) stuff. I suspect this is the low-level implementation of things like native-driver which is valuable to have at ones fingertips.
*   While not automation related directly, if you are automating Android stuff you should also be looking at the [Android Design](http://developer.android.com/design/index.html) site to understand the idioms and such that the platform thinks you should be using
*   [The road to faster tests](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2742-the-road-to-faster-tests) is a fantastic write-up of an investigation into why their scripts were so slow. Iâ€™ve been doing this a lot recently. Well, investigating slowness at least.
*   I actually got the above link from [How We Reduced Our Rails Test Runtimes By 10x](http://engineering.socialcast.com/2012/01/how-we-reduced-our-test-runtimes/) which is an even larger investigation write-up.
