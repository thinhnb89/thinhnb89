Its that time again, [4th Annual Automation Honors Voting](http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/index.php?option=com_jforms&view=form&id=22&Itemid=183) is now open. Vanity contests FTW!

*   [Introducing the Sauce Plugin for Selenium Grid](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/09/introducing-the-sauce-plugin-for-selenium-grid/) from a product perspective is _huge_. And in a roundabout way proves I am not completely crazy…
*   [Benchmark of Python WSGI Servers](http://nichol.as/benchmark-of-python-web-servers) has lots of numbers, and graphs and charts.
*   [Seleno](http://teststack.github.com/TestStack.Seleno/) makes some bold marketing statements (‘the RIGHT way!’). Looks like a framework in C# that forces people to use Page Objects
*   [Automating an SVG game with Selenium WebDriver](http://vimeo.com/30591662) from [Andreas Tolf Tolfsen](http://vimeo.com/user5310124) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).
    
*   [Splinter](http://splinter.cobrateam.info) is another python web automation framework. How long until this gets marketed as the next Selenium killer that uses WebDriver under the hood.
*   If you’re using Maven, [maven-notification-center](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/maven-notification-center) could be interesting. Well, if you are also using Mountain Lion.
*   And I quote from [Acceptance Testing Revisited](http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Acceptance-Testing-Revisited.html) – _Asking customers to read and write acceptance tests is a poor use of their time, skill, and inclinations._. THIS!
*   OH NOES! [Your Credit Card Pin has been leaked!](http://pastebin.com/2qbRKh3R)!!!
*   [Testing Automation With Selenium – Part 1](http://java.dzone.com/articles/testing-automation-selenium) starts with _Never send a human to do a machine’s job_ but also omits _Never send a machine to do a human’s job_
*   [Dog Show Quality](http://workroomprds.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/dog-show-quality.html) is where “Quality” is its own goal. That’s from about halfway through the article. Hands up when see this with automation all. the. freaking. time. (All your hands should be up. OK, you can put the down now.)
