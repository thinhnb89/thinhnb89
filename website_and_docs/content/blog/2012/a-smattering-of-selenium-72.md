January means its time to escape from under the deadlines I found myself under during December so some of this stuff is a month old (or older!). Hopefully it is still interesting though.

*   Localizing automation well is something I’ve seen people struggle with. [Creating Multi-Language Web Applications with Zend\_Translate](http://devzone.zend.com/1859/creating-multi-language-web-applications-with-zend_translate/) is a possible solution for PHP folks.
*   [Using Spinach with Selenium](http://wesgibbs.me/post/12036950233/using-spinach-with-selenium) and of course Spinach seems to be a different implementation of Cucumber. (And yes, I’m sure that’s a great oversimplification.)
*   [Introducing Android WebDriver](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/10/introducing-android-webdriver.html) more or less made the selenium search I have for twitter useless for a day-and-a-half with all the retweets.
*   [Selenium Webdriver – Wait for an element to load](http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/selenium-webdriver---wait-for-an-element-to-load/64) shows the difference between an explicit and implicit wait
*   [Testing GWT Apps with Selenium or WebDriver](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/10/testing-gwt-apps-with-selenium-or.html) – take note of problem 3. Friends don’t let friends use GWT…
*   [The developer’s guide to browser adoption rates](http://www.netmagazine.com/node/1465) is the sort of thing anyone doing browser automation needs to know about
*   [integrate your selenium test cases into nagios](http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Websites%2C-Forms-and-Transactions/check_selenium/details) – this is something I keep thinking I should try out.
*   [Continuous Integration Principles–Task Size Rules](http://jayflowers.com/WordPress/?p=222) has a diagram that seems about right — even if I haven’t really thought about it in great depth.
*   [Another robust way of how to locate ajax elements using Selenium 2 + webdriver](http://razgulyaev.blogspot.com/2011/11/another-robust-way-of-how-to-locate.html) kinda looks like a re-implementation of the WebDriverWait stuff
*   [A tale of three ruby automated testing APIs (redux)](http://watirmelon.com/2011/12/03/a-tale-of-three-ruby-automated-testing-apis-redux/) was in an earlier queue, until he pulled it down. Now that its back, its back here too.
