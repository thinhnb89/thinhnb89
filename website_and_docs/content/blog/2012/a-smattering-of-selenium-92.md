What’s that? Eight days in a row? That’s right…

*   [lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits) seems almost funny enough to be a good idea
*   [A vision for Cucumber 2.0](http://blog.mattwynne.net/2012/04/26/a-vision-for-cucumber-2-0/) is rather interesting
*   [Install Firefox on Amazon Linux X86\_64 Compiling GTK+](http://joekiller.com/2012/06/03/install-firefox-on-amazon-linux-x86_64-compiling-gtk/) is not something I have had to do. But then again, I haven’t tried.
*   [Nerrvana](http://www.nerrvana.com/) is yet another Selenium-As-A-Service provider. Looks like they are taking the ‘upload to our servers and run as a scheduled job’ approach rather than real-time.
*   [Ext JS 4.1 Performance](http://www.sencha.com/blog/ext-js-4-1-performance) is important stuff if you are using this toolkit. (I also like how they author is _Nige “Animal” White_ — note that I did not add the animal part myself)
*   Dunno if it is just who I follow of if the Ruby / PHP communities just don’t post this sort of thing, but [How Callables Work](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/23/python-internals-how-callables-work/) is another geeky Python post
*   [Scaling CI at Etsy: Divide and Concur, Revisited](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/12/scaling-ci-at-etsy-divide-and-concur-revisited/) is the lightsaber heuristic in action — only around Jenkins plugins this time.
*   [RSpec is not the reason your rails test suite is slow](https://gist.github.com/2050539) is a gist along the theme of ‘slow tests are slow but not for the reasons you think’
    {{< gist dchelimsky 2050539 >}}
*   I really don’t like integrations that are all-or-nothing from a philisophical perspective, but if you are look at using Sauce OnDemand with Behat, [Behat-Sauce](https://github.com/Shashi-ibuildings/Behat-Sauce) is what you want.
*   [Top 10 Reasons No One Uses Your Testing Tool](http://www.slideshare.net/c.titus.brown/pycon-2012-tip-bof-intro-slides) from this year’s PyCon is so accurate it is spooky.
