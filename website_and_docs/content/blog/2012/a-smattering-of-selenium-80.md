I should have learned not to boast about getting caught up with links.

*   [Automating BrowserID with Selenium](http://blargon7.com/2012/02/automating-browserid-with-selenium/) is pretty awesome. (As is BrowserID.) Now if this was only installable via pip or easy\_install…
*   [Ruby Trick Shots](http://rubyreloaded.com/trickshots/) – heed the disclaimer; _not an exercise in Ruby best practices_
*   [Keep It Functional – iPhone Test Automation](https://devblog.xing.com/qa/keep-it-functional-iphone-test-automation/) talks about another automation framework for mobile. At some point Selenium is going to grow Objective-C bindings I fear.
*   Requests for Python is fantastic. [Requests for PHP](http://requests.ryanmccue.info/) looks to be equally so. (I suspect my [php webdriver bindings](http://element34.ca/blog/introducing-phpwebdriver) are about to become a much larger fork of the Facebook ones.)
*   [Is Test Automation a “Project”?](http://test.techwell.com/articles/membersub/test-automation-project) – hint: it’s not.
*   [Keeping Selenium Tests 100% Blue](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2012/01/sfse-meetup-video-keeping-selenium-tests-100-blue/) is a video of January’s SFSE. And [Selenium Meetup West Coast Style](http://blog.testyredhead.com/2012/01/31/selenium-meetup-west-coast-style.aspx) is a rebuttal.
*   [Selenium’s Sweet Spot: Preventing Catastrophes](http://4cupsr.us/blog/2012/1/8/seleniums-sweet-spot-preventing-catastrophes.html) shows that there are still people who do not watch for Black Swans. Automation does not prevent catastrophes. Well, at least ones that you are not looking for already.
*   [Automate Salesforce Administrative Tasks with Selenium](http://blog.cloudspokes.com/2012/01/automate-salesforce-administrative.html) has the results of the contest they ran.
*   [ErrorList object for use in TestNG/Selenium testing](http://robert.arles.us/node/150) is a soft-assert implementation
*   [Iterations](http://gazit.me/2012/02/01/iterations.html) has an outstanding time-lapse of how the Pycon US logo was designed. Someone should do this scripting out a website.

And my post that I’m going to link against is a bit of a rant around [how to choose selenium training](http://element34.ca/blog/how-to-choose-selenium-training). Though it has also been pointed out that a lot it applies outside the scope of Selenium as well.
