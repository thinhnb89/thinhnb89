  Happy day off Canuckistan!

Happy day off Canuckistan! Iâ€™ll be in California in two weeks; here is [my schedule](http://element34.ca/blog/california-tour-summer-2012) â€” come by and chat

*   [Selenium Rc to Webdriver Migration â€“ Part2](http://allianceglobalservices.com/blog/selenium-rc-to-webdriver-migration-â€“-part2) is included mainly for the IE bit. Busted SSL certificate? Donâ€™t work around the problem â€” fix it! Canâ€™t find an element? Synchronize properly â€” donâ€™t just bap it in the face with the magic implicit wait wandâ€¦
*   [Google I/O 2012 Videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers?feature=watch) wonâ€™t give you the loot attendees got, just the content.
*   Does WebDriver support [Jelly Bean](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean.html) yet? /me ducks and runs for cover
*   [Scaling Continuous Integration â€“ Cutting Test Time by 77%](http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/scaling-continuous-integration-cutting-test-time-by-77/) â€“ my Spidey sense says that the next wave of tooling is about dynamic script selection, parallelization and general speediness-ing. In this article _since thereâ€™s no longer a need to delay arbitrary amounts of time_ is the killer line.
*   [jQuery Core: Version 1.9 and Beyond](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/28/jquery-core-version-1-9-and-beyond/) seems rather optimistic. WebDriver should be immune \[I think\] though so if your scripts break, its the app! ðŸ™‚
*   Myth #2 of [Cucumber: Itâ€™s about Talking not Testing](https://speakerdeck.com/u/chrismdp/p/cucumber-its-about-talking-not-testing) is outstanding. And sadly, nearly ubiquitous
*   [Unicode for dummies â€” Encoding](http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/unicode-for-dummies-encoding/) â€“ be afraid of any article that starts with _The basic concepts are simple_. Then brace yourself and read it anyways. Unicode is important.
*   [Cloud-powered Continuous Integration and Deployment architectures](http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/cloudpowered-continuous-integration-and-deployment-architectures-jinesh-varia) is very AWS centric (obviously given the author) but still pretty good.
*   Canâ€™t get enough of Responsive Design? How about [Responsive Images: How they Almost Worked and What We Need](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-images-how-they-almost-worked-and-what-we-need/)
*   This would have been more relevant last week when it was [Back To The Future day](http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/back-to-the-future-day-hoax-hits-again/272599), but [Delorean](https://github.com/bebanjo/delorean) lets you muck about with time in your Ruby scripts
