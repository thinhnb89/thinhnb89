Yes. I know. I missed a day. But 13 in a row was a good run!

*   [Free Automated Cross-Browser JavaScript Testing](http://blog.parse.com/2012/06/28/free-automated-cross-browser-javascript-testing/) is a pretty standard ‘here is how you do it’ article — until you get to the IE section. It has a trick I don’t think I’ve seen yet.
*   If you don’t want to use a Proxy to generate HAR files, you can use NetExport in your Firefox profile to save things locally, or sent them to a remote server as explained in [Automate Page Load Performance Testing with Firebug and Selenium](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/automate-page-load-performance-testing-with-firebug-and-selenium/). (I like the proxy route myself since it is cross browser.)
*   [Automatic Firefox authentication when using Selenium-WebDriver with AutoAuth](http://watirmelon.com/2012/06/27/automatic-firefox-authentication-when-using-selenium-webdriver-with-autoauth/) is Watir-based, but would also work for WebDriver
*   [Introducing RoboHydra – Opera’s open-source HTTP client test tool](http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2012/06/27/introducing-robohydra-operas-open-source-http-client-test-tool) seems to take the whole ‘take this service and stub it!’ approach
*   [Creating and working with parametrized test resources](http://pytest.org/dev/resources.html) is a peek at what could be coming soon to a Py.Test installation near you. Also makes my brain hurt.
*   [Communicating with RESTful APIs in Python](http://isbullsh.it/2012/06/Rest-api-in-python/) nicely illustrates why you should also be using Requests
*   [Whither NuGet and the WebDriver .NET bindings](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/06/whither-nuget-and-webdriver-net.html) explains the whole NuGet and WebDriver .NET mess(?). Again I say, packaging is hard.
*   [Git rebase: be a mother, not a plastic surgeon](http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2012/06/16/Git-rebase-be-a-mother-not-a-plastic-surgeon) — has git taken the place of gdb for top of the arcane knowledge food chain?
*   [Real-life Generators and a Peeker Too](http://hairysun.com/blog/2012/06/28/real-life-generators-and-peeker/) shows that I don’t know anything about Generators let alone the idea of a Peeker. Though I suspect I have needed this trick in the past.
*   Remember the good ol’ days when a browser could take out your OS? They’re baaaack. [Beta and Stable Channel Update](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.ca/2012/06/beta-and-stable-channel-update.html)
