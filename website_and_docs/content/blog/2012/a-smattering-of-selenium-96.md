Blech. Supposed to go car shopping today. Any car brands want to sponsor my wife with a car so I can do something productive? Worth a shotâ€¦

*   [jbehave-selenium](https://github.com/pnakhat/jbehave-selenium) is a sample project that uses, unsurprisingly, jbehave and selenium. Sample projects are outstanding.
*   Just as samples are good, so are playgrounds. [Itâ€™s playtime â€“ Light Table Playground released](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/06/24/its-playtime/)
*   And [try jasmine!](http://www.tryjasmine.com/)
*   [Announcing Joyride](http://litmus.com/blog/joyride-website-acceptance-testing) is another â€˜browser automation without programming as a serviceâ€™ site
*   [Announcing pytest-mozwebqa 1.0](http://blargon7.com/2012/06/announcing-pytest-mozwebqa-1-0/) has a bunch of things I need to steal, erm borrow, erm be inspired by for my stuff ([Py.Saunter](http://element34.ca/products/saunter/pysaunter))
*   As a builder of frameworks, [Sauce labs tests with meaningful names](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11148009/sauce-labs-tests-with-meaningful-names) is the sort of madness I need to deal with
*   [Feature and scenario outline name in cucumber before hook](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11209066/feature-and-scenario-outline-name-in-cucumber-before-hook) is in the same vein
*   [pyccuracy](https://github.com/heynemann/pyccuracy) is a BDD framework for Python
*   [SpecLoud](https://github.com/hugobr/specloud) is the same-ish thing, but using nose
*   [VsVim](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329/) could make VisualStudio a viable development platform ðŸ˜‰
