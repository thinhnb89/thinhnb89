Going to be on an airplane for the better part of the next day, so will likely miss some links … unless I am tagged on [twitter](http://twitter.com/adamgoucher) with it.

*   [Introducing The Driver Binary Downloader Maven Plugin For Selenium](http://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/08/introducing-the-driver-binary-downloader-maven-plugin-for-selenium/) solves a problem that has been solved a couple times but this seems the slickest. Normally I would suggest just using Chef/Puppet for this but it makes sense in the Maven context. I think.
*   Speaking of Maven, [Maven Tiles](https://github.com/maoo/maven-tiles) brings modularity to your modularity
*   [Maven, Android, Travis-CI and More Awesome Sauce](http://levi-wilson.blogspot.ca/2012/06/maven-android-travis-ci-and-more.html)
*   Google’s Olympics Doodles … with Watir
    *   [Hurdles](http://filipin.eu/automating-google-hurdles)
    *   [Basketball](http://filipin.eu/automating-google-basketball)
    *   [Slalom Canoe](http://filipin.eu/automating-google-slalom-canoe)
    *   [Soccer](http://filipin.eu/automating-google-soccer)
*   And using Sikuli to automate [Hurdles](http://knorrium.info/2012/08/07/automating-the-hurdles-google-doodle/)
*   [When to Use Test Automation (and when not to)](http://www.webapptesting.com/when-to-use-test-automation-and-when-not-to/2012/08/) is barely just the tip of the iceberg
*   [Building and testing at Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building-and-testing-at-facebook/10151004157328920) is meh (and/or scary depending on whether your come from a dev or test background) but ‘gatekeeper’ sounds pretty rad. And is not currently on their github page.
*   [RSpec: Thank You for Running My Tests in Random Order](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/08/09/rspec-thank-you-for-running-my-tests-in-random-order/) — well, _Test interaction sucks_ summarizes things pretty well.
*   [Documenting a mobile interface using Chrome’s user agent setting](http://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/documenting-a-mobile-interface-using-chromes-user-agent-setting) is a useful trick. Can we change the user-agent through WebDriver?
*   [Handle popup windows in Selenium 2](http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/twist/2.3/help/how_do_i_handle_popup_in_selenium2.html) uses a different trick to find windows than I use. And thats a good thing.
