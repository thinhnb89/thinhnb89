We’re excited to announce that we’ve finally determined where and when Selenium Conf will be happening this Fall.

Our initial goal was to bring the event to a new country, but for a number of reasons that proved more challenging than we’d hoped. But in 2012 we had the 2nd annual Selenium Conf in London, and we’re pleased to be bringing it back there this year!

The conference will be held at The Mermaid in downtown London on November 14-16:

*   The 14th will be all-day pre-conference workshops
*   The 15th-16th will be the conference

Go [here](http://seleniumconf.co.uk/) to sign up for the email list for conference updates (e.g., when tickets go on sale) as well as submit a talk. Call for speakers are open from now until July 29th.
