  We're very happy to announce the new look for the Selenium website!

We have been working hard during the last few weeks redoing our
[website](//selenium.dev). Today, we are very happy to share it 
with the community and we are hoping to get as much feedback as
possible!

We did a major revamp to our website two years ago. However, this
revamp had some "technical debt" in it...

{{< tweet user="SeleniumHQ" id="1194205732347887616" >}}

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate our website, and to
build a website with Hugo, one normally needs to select a 
[Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Our previous website was
being built using two different Hugo themes, which was less than
ideal. Having two Hugo themes was hard to maintain and accepting
contributions was tricky in some cases.

This new website version is using the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy)
theme, made by some folks at Google and used by other popular projects
such as [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Using Docsy helps us to focus
more on the website's content rather than spending lots of time
maintaining the underlying details of it. 

We all hope you will like the new look and please check our 
[contribution guidelines](/documentation/about/contributing/) if
you want to contribute to the Selenium website.


Happy testing!
