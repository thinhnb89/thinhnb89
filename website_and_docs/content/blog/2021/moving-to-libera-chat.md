  Moving to Libera.Chat
---


Yesterday, 19 May 2021, all the staff of Freenode, the IRC network, [collectively
resigned as staff because of what they felt was a hostile takeover](https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt).

Freenode has always been seen as the home of Free and Open Software, so
 it was natural that you could find us on the #selenium channel there. To maintain this openness, and inclusivity,
we are moving our IRC Channel over to [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat). It is has been created
by the team that previously maintained Freenode.

We are in the process of moving our Slack-to-IRC bridge over and hopefully the matrix bridge will be created
soon so that we can have a free and inclusive project on the new IRC Servers. There may be a few
hiccups so if you could bear with us.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/automatedtester)
or on one of the [chat protocols](https://selenium.dev/support) we support.

Finally, thank you to "Milen from Bulgaria" for helping secure the channel for us on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat).
