Its been almost a month, so time for a flurry of Smatterings.

*   Maven has a bad reputation in some circles (ignoring for a second that you are using Java…), but should you be using it the [QuickStart Archetype](https://github.com/sebarmeli/Selenium2-Java-QuickStart-Archetype) looks interesting.
*   [Why Your Monitoring Is Lying To You](http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/15/why-your-monitoring-is-lying-to-you/) talks about types of logging which are valuable both from a Continuous Delivery perspective and for checking the health of your application during long script runs.
*   I still maintain that they who nails QC integration with/for Se will get buckets of money from people. Here is one attempt at it: [Quality Center Integration](http://www.one-shore.com/quality-center-integration/)
*   [Good to Great Python reads](http://jessenoller.com/good-to-great-python-reads/) is I think now on my list of things to hand new (and seasoned) Python folks.
*   [Test Harness Design Patterns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163752.aspx) is from 2005 but still interesting.
*   [jacuzzi](http://rubydoc.info/gems/jacuzzi/0.1.4/frames) is _superficial wrapper over RSpec + Capybara + Selenium test setup and execution_
*   Because I don’t already have enough backlog on videos, the [2011 Jenkins User Conference videos](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb) are now online. Though behind a registration wall. I know why companies do this, but boo on you.
*   _This_ is how you publish videos from a conferences – [GTAC 2011](http://www.gtac.biz/talks). Note that this is how SeConf did it too..
*   [Awesome Page Objects In Testing](http://itreallymatters.net/post/12242886944/awesome-page-objects-in-testing) uses Bing as its example to explain Page Objects in Ruby
*   Ignore the Se-IDE suggestion, but [Improving Your Drupal Testing Process](http://evolvingweb.ca/story/improving-your-drupal-testing-process) has an ‘assumed to work’ list specifically spelled out. Too often this is not explicitly made — and agreed upon as acceptable risks by stakeholders
