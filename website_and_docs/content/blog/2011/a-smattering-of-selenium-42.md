Is this week’s post the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything Selenium?

*   [Selenium 2 – Get Number of Rows in a Table](http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/selenium-2---get-number-of-rows-in-a-table/52) illustrates what is advertised, though it feels like there has to be a shorter way to do this along the lines of getXpathCount() or getCssCount()
*   [Atlassian Plugin SDK – how to provide optional selenium tests](http://leonardinius.blogspot.com/2011/02/atlassian-plugin-sdk-how-to-provide.html) explains how to wire up Se with the Atlassian toolkit and has a couple task specific tips as well.
*   [Automated Test for Facebook Canvas Apps – Front-end automation with Selenium](http://jwbito.ballardview.com/2011/02/automated-test-for-facebook-canvas-apps.html) is very buzzword compliant: Selenium-WebDriver, Facebook, Canvas. All it needs is to run on a mobile device.
*   Sauce Labs have released [Se-Builder](http://code.google.com/p/se-builder/) which is their interpretation of what a next generation record/playback tool might look like.
*   I’m sure I had to know about this already, but [Jenkins: The Definitive Guide](http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book) is an open-source book on everyone’s favourite politically embroiled CI server. Speaking of politics, here is an [interesting graph](http://daniel.gredler.net/2011/02/15/hudson-and-jenkins-two-weeks-later/).
*   [Measure Anything, Measure Everything](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/) seems pretty cool. Suspect you could do something in your scripts to ping the counter so you could get visualizations of your runs.
*   [Se-IDE Natural Language Extension](https://github.com/energizedwork/selenium-ide-nle) is _very_ cool. Now, if only they had gone the extra step to make it a [plugin](http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/plugins.html)
*   [Pushing the Boundaries of Test Automation](http://blog.bettersoftwaretesting.com/?p=16) is useful if you too are pushing boundaries — and most people are at least once per application
*   [Lift Testing](https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Testing) has an example of writing Se scripts using ScalaTest. Think that is the first time I’ve seen that.
*   [Custom C# formatter for Selenium](http://koenwillemse.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/custom-c-formatter-for-selenium/) details a bit of the journey and links to a formatter that uses [Fluent Assertions](http://fluentassertions.codeplex.com/).
*   [The Case for “Longevity/Endurance” (Session-Based Testing) in Selenium](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/stephend/archives/2011/02/the_case_for_se.html) partially rebuts the single, small, Se script idea. Or at least provides a counter example.
*   I hack runners for fun, so [A Unit Testing Framework In 44 Lines Of Ruby](http://www.skorks.com/2011/02/a-unit-testing-framework-in-44-lines-of-ruby/) has all sorts of geek appeal.
*   [Hacking Selenium to improve its performance on IE](http://www.ivaturi.org/home/hackingseleniumtoimproveitsperformanceonie) has, well, hacks to improve Se time on IE. These are Se-RC specific, but came up in an Se-WebDriver context.
*   [Automatiser les tests Selenium avec Maven](http://blog.xebia.fr/2011/02/18/automatiser-les-tests-selenium-avec-maven/) took over the selenium twitter search for a day or so — which isn’t that interesting except that it is French. Seems there is an under-served market there. Oh, and Google Translate is horrible on pom.xml examples.
*   [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) is another of those things that would be fun to integrate into a Se run
