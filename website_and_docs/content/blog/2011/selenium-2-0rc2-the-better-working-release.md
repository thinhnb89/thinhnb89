You win some and you lose some. Weâ€™d been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. Thatâ€™s definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and have [released Selenium 2.0rc2](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list). Itâ€™s the same as rc1, but with fewer problems ðŸ™‚

Weâ€™re still very keen to hear your feedback! Let us know what you think!
