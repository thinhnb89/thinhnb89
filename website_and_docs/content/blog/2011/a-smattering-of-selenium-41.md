There isn’t an official announcement anywhere (yet) but Selenium 2.0b2 was released a couple hours ago. Time to upgrade all your servers. Beta 3 is going to focus on IE9 and FF4 support.

Meanwhile…

*   [A Webinar on Automated Selenium Testing with Maestro 3](http://www.maestrodev.com/events/webinar/a-webinar-on-automated-selenium-testing-with-maestro-3) could be interesting if you are considering the Maestro platform.
*   And sticking with the webinar idea, Sauce Labs is hosting [Selenium 2 Webinar: The Next Generation of Web and Mobile Application Testing](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/02/selenium-2-webinar-the-next-generation-of-web-and-mobile-application-testing/)
*   After a bit of stagnation, the [official Python drivers](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/) are starting to get updated again.
*   After almost a year, a new version of [js-test-driver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) is out.
*   [Selenium Sushi](http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/web-testing-with-selenium-sushi-a-practical-guide-and-toolset/) is a support library / package for .NET
*   [Window Driver Pattern for Acceptance Tests](http://www.typo3-media.com/blog/window-driver-page-object-selenium-tests.html) illustrates Page Objects for PHP (though I don’t think it goes as far as it should in terms of abstractions).
*   Aside from locators, the next biggest pain point is synchronization. [Advanced Selenium Synchronization with ‘Latches’](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/02/advanced-selenium-synchronization-with-latches/) is how I address that.
*   Need an easy way to communicate Selenese steps on something like Stack Overflow? The [Separated Values Formatter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/separated-values-formatter/) could be just the trick.
*   Selenesse is a mash-up of Fitnesse and Selenium. If you are going to StarEast and want to learn it from one of the maintainers then [Want to learn SeleNesse hands-on?](http://www.passionatetester.com/2011/02/want-to-learn-selenesse-hands-on.html) is for you.
*   [Your automated acceptance tests needn’t be written in the same language as your system being tested](http://watirmelon.com/2011/02/07/your-automated-acceptance-tests-neednt-be-written-in-the-same-language-as-your-system-being-tested/) explains a trap that too many teams fall into
