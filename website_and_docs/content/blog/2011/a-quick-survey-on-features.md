Rather than surprising the general community in ways that we have become somewhat known for, I figured I would try something new. Actually asking about usage of things before changing them in fundamental ways.

To this end, I have created a quick(!) [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF) about changes that are under consideration regarding UI-Maps and how Se-IDE is opened.

The [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF) is only two questions, so I’m hoping for a large response. I’ll post the results next Monday (August 8, 2011).

One more time for good luck, the survey is over [here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF).
