*   [Distributing the Same Test to Multiple Processes](http://brian-oneill.com/2011/08/02/distributing-the-same-test-to-multiple-processes/) shows a technique for debugging flaky scripts
*   Repeat after me: I will not automate GMail unless I am Google. Or if you will, you will do something like what is described in [Verify email confirmation using Selenium](http://seleniumsoftwaretesting.blogspot.com/2011/08/verify-email-confirmation-using.html). Notice that they are _not_ using Se for it.
*   [Selenium and Nagios](http://devops-abyss.blogspot.com/2010/06/selenium-and-nagios.html) is something more teams should do I think.
*   ‘This started out as a…’ usually means the discovery of a rabbit hole. [Towards better acceptance test automation…](http://madcoderspeak.blogspot.com/2011/07/towards-better-acceptance-test.html) has a great diagram where all roads lead to accidental complexity and [The A Team](http://madcoderspeak.blogspot.com/2011/07/a-team.html) the proposes solutions to those complexity problems.
*   [Specialized Skills](http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/2011/08/01/specialized-skills/) remarks that ‘life is like a box of crayons’ — I’ve been having this conversation around automation again recently. When everyone blurs their specialization boundaries you have a \[chance\] of success.
*   [Performance Testing Practice Named During Online Summit](http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/8661) names a practice we’ve often used — _User Experience Under Load_
*   [Introducing page-object gem](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2011/07/29/introducing-page-object-gem/) showcases a pretty nice looking gem.
*   Often people link to W3Schools.com when explaining XPath, CSS, etc. Please don’t. [W3Fools](http://w3fools.com/) explains why.
*   Is there another Se-in-the-cloud provider coming? The [testingbot](http://rubygems.org/gems/testingbot) gem seems to imply so
*   [FluentLenium](https://github.com/MathildeLemee/FluentLenium) lets you write JUnit scripts that look like JQuery code
*   [Mining Cucumber Features](http://blog.josephwilk.net/cucumber/mining-cucumber-features.html) has a cool investigation trick that could be adopted to larger scopes than just cucumber
*   [Image to CSS Conversion with Img to CSS API](http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/06/api-stack-image-to-css-conversion-with-img-to-css-api/) is likely something I would explore if I was going to compare page image contents.
*   Selenium IDE I think runs afoul of the [attractive nuisance doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine)
*   Are you a tool vendor? Here are some steps you can take to [avoid a curse being placed upon you](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/596)
*   [Test automation that helps, A Guardian Content API example](http://www.investigatingsoftware.co.uk/2011/08/test-automation-that-helps-guardian.html) is a bit of an exploratory automation experience report but also reminds that the point of all this is to get new information.
*   [Your Chrome browser might not be using HTTP anymore](http://blog.alertfox.com/2011/05/your-chrome-browser-might-not-be-using.html) is my new Example One for why the browser vendors need to be the ones to provide the automation hooks. Which in this case, they do.
