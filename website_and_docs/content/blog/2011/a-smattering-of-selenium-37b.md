Let’s see how many announcements there were that didn’t get pushed out in a timely manner today shall we?

*   Well, there is of course [Selenium Conf is coming](https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/selenium-conf-is-coming-get-your-proposals-in/) and you have until Friday to get your proposals in. Last I heard we had 37 which is impressive, but I think 50 should be doable.
*   On the meetup side of things there is
    *   [Boston on January 25](http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Selenium-Users-Group/calendar/15997626/)
    *   [NYC on January 26](http://www.meetup.com/NYCSelenium/) (its not on the site yet, but I’m speaking, so trust me, it exists)
    *   [London on March 23](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/calendar/16079171/)
*   [SeleniumCamp](http://seleniumcamp.com/) ([English](http://translate.google.ca/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fseleniumcamp.com%2F&sl=ru&tl=en&hl=&ie=UTF-8)) is coming to Kiev at the end of February. Suddenly we go from no ‘events’ to lots.
*   I’m kinda surprised no one has done this one yet, but a [FitNesse Formatter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-fitnesse-formatte/) plugin for Se-IDE is up on AMO
*   [Selenium Expert](http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2010/12/28/the-selenium-expert-is-here/) is a plugin that _brings the wonderful world of inspections, tips, hints, fixes and refactoring to Selenese_. Samit is a plug-in making machine.
*   Gorilla Logic have [have released a new version of FlexMonkium](http://blog.gorillalogic.com/2010/12/16/flexmonkium-4-1-4-released/) — with with fully synchronized versioning.
*   [SeleniuMspec](http://seleniumspec.codeplex.com/) is a cleverly named formatter for Mspec — though it isn’t distributed as an Se-IDE plugin (which would +1 its coolness)
*   And I quote, _Hewlett-Packard (HP) is announcing the discontinuance of HP WinRunner (WR) 7.5, 7.6, 8.0, 8.2, 9.2 (all editions) products._. Is it wrong to say something like ‘Ding, dong, the witch is dead’?. Of course, we wouldn’t likely be here without WR, but who doesn’t love some friendly-ish ribbing? Here is he full [notice](http://support.openview.hp.com/encore/wr.jsp).
*   [Krypton](http://www.getkrypton.com/) appears to be a cloud service for managing your Se scripts and has a ‘we need testers’ box on their site if anyone is curious
*   And to illustrate that this space seems to have potential, or people think it does at any rate, [Test Runnr](http://www.testrunnr.com/) also does cloud based script management with the added feature of running scripts against the [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com) OnDemand cloud. So if you have a cloud based app that you script with Selenium stored in the cloud and executed in the cloud are you yourself a meta-cloud company?

More tomorrow as we dig ourselves out of the hole.
