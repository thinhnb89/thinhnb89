Half a century!

And because I am late doing this, the [Selenium Test Day for Addons.Mozilla.org](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2011/selenium-test-day-amo-240511.html) — which is _today!_ gets top billing. Its actually going on Right Now. Looking to practice script writing and/or up your profile? This is a great way.

And now for the usual stuff.

*   [.NET Headless browser options](http://testerthoughts.com/2011/05/17/guest-post-net-headless-browser-options/) looks at various options that might be available to you if you want something like HTMLUnit but for .NET.
*   CSS vs. XPath is one of the great talking points in the Se community. And until now there hasn’t been any hard information to support the claims. [Why CSS Locators are the way to go vs XPath](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/05/why-css-locators-are-the-way-to-go-vs-xpath/) now solves that problem.
*   [Heuristics For Creating Automated Regression Tests](http://testingpodcast.com/iwst-heuristics-for-creating-automated-regression-tests/) as recorded from a IWST session late last year
*   [Functional Testing with Selenium WebDriver and Scala](http://mkaz.com/archives/1705/functional-testing-with-selenium-webdriver-and-scala/). Don’t think I’ve ever actually seen that language before.
*   Here is a useful StackOverflow question – [How to add a JUnit 4 test that doesn’t extend from TestCase to a TestSuite?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/211487/how-to-add-a-junit-4-test-that-doesnt-extend-from-testcase-to-a-testsuite)
*   [‘Pushing the boundaries of User Experience Test Automation’ slides](http://blog.bettersoftwaretesting.com/?attachment_id=24) from the STEP-AUTO conference. Not that useful without Julian in front of them, but check out slide 17
*   The [Current State of Jenkins](http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/current-state-of-jenkins) deck is interesting, but slide 9 specifically is what the Se community could learn from.
*   Need to add automation hooks? Have a look at the [data- attributes](http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/). Why, oh why don’t I use these more?
*   People should write more spelunking post like [Spelunking Selenium in Search of Sockets](http://rubysource.com/spelunking-selenium-in-search-of-sockets/)
*   I’m doing a [webinar for PushToTest](http://www.pushtotest.com/adam-goucher) on Thursday. Haven’t done one of those before…
*   A [Continuous Delivery video from the London Test Gathering](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/talk-by-dave-farley) — I really wish I had time to watch videos these days.
*   If you are using Python’s unittest module, then [PyJUnitXML](https://launchpad.net/pyjunitxml) is going to help prevent you from re-re-rewriting the ‘ant junit xml’ format
*   [Traits](http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/) is a bit of a type system for Python. I think.
*   Not that I use any of these, but [this seems like a nice tutorial on JBehave, Spring MVC and WebDriver](http://alexsotob.blogspot.com/2011/04/are-you-locked-up-in-world-thats-been.html)
*   Looking for Snake Oil? I present to you [Snake Oil](http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/05/18/researcher-develops-automatic-software-testing/)
*   [twin](http://code.google.com/p/twin/) looks rather cool. Now all it needs is the same language support as WebDriver and we might have a tight way to deal with the desktop and browser
*   So who is going to add a link to [Logging Selenium 2 Events in Twist](http://twist4all.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/logging-selenium-2-events-in-twist/) or similar to the Se Documentation?
*   The [page object gem](https://github.com/cheezy/page-object) could help with adoption of this pattern. Or could hopelessly confuse the pattern with the gem’s implementation of the pattern. Based on past experience, my money is on the latter.
*   [The Architecture of Open Source](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/the-architecture-of-open-source-applications/15819207) book has been released and includes a chapter on Selenium by Simon Stewart. Buy it from this link, not Amazon — all royalties are going to Amnesty International and Amazon takes a huge slice
