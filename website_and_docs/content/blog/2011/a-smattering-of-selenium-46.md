  Selenium IDE on Firefox 4 is Available for Testing!
---

Let’s put [Selenium IDE on Firefox 4 is Available for Testing! Now!](http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2011/04/07/selenium-ide-on-firefox-4-is-available-for-testing-now/) outside of the normal list. We have a ‘working’ version of Se-IDE for FF4, but don’t really have too too much faith in it (or at least I don’t). Please help test it.

*   [Eight Techniques to Improve Your Tests](http://www.pragprog.com/magazines/2011-04/test-abstraction) is focused on unit tests, but I’m sure something can be gained from them
*   Runners are great fun. [How the play framework test runner works](http://www.devinprogress.info/2011/04/how-play-framework-test-runner-works.html) is therefor also great fun.
*   Manage your EC2 instances in your Grid with [rubber](https://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber); a plugin for capistrano
*   Some post SeConf blogs are starting to appear
    *   Michael Larsen’s [Day One](http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/2011/04/selenium-conference-day-1.html), [Day Two](http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/2011/04/selenium-conference-day-2.html), [Day Three](http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/2011/04/selenium-conference-day-3.html)
    *   Andy Tinkham [mindmapped it](http://testerthoughts.com/2011/04/08/mind-mapping-the-selenium-conference-2011/)
*   While not related directly to automation [The writing process](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/03/30/the-writing-process/) mimics the script creation process; at least for me.
*   [AffirmIt!](http://www.affirmit.org/) is an April Fool’s joke (I think!) but still good anyways.
*   [Selenium Fury](https://github.com/scottcsims/SeleniumFury) is a Page Object factory for Ruby.
*   It is always important to remember the [Bugs that automated tests aren’t good at finding](http://www.testingmentor.com/imtesty/2011/03/27/bugs-that-automated-tests-arent-good-at-finding/)
*   Care about using Twist with either the Android or IOS WebDriver APIs? [Configuring Twist for Selenium 2](http://twist4all.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/twist-selenium2/) could make you happy then.
*   [Logs Are Streams, Not Files](http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/1/logs_are_streams_not_files/) is an interesting notion to remember.
*   All the talks from [CukeUp!](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-testing/cukeup/js-1541) are online. Because I need to have even _more_ things to not to have time to watch.
*   [Selenium Commands & Locators Explained](http://blog.softwaretestingclub.com/2011/04/selenium-commands-locators-explained/) is the next in Dave Hunt’s guest series at the Software Testing Club. Pay extra attention to the last sentence of the Link section
*   [Spynner](http://code.google.com/p/spynner/) is a _stateful programmatic web browser module for Python with Javascript/AJAX support based upon the QtWebKit framework_
*   [Bring out your dead!](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/8d79c5ee3913f82d) applies just as much to Selenium as it does Python.
*   No idea how I found [design of selenium tests for asp net](http://code.google.com/p/design-of-selenium-tests-for-asp-net/) seems pretty useful. Or at least from the table of contents.
*   The [Java technology zone technical podcast series](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-gloverpodcast2/index.html#huggins) has a pretty current podcast with Jason Huggins and Simon Stewart that deals with upgrades, etc.
*   [XPath, CSS, DOM and Selenium: The Rosetta Stone](http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/xpath,-css,-dom-and-selenium-the-rosetta-stone/) — given we spent all week last week harping on using CSS instead of XPath, this is a win.
*   An excellent reminder that it is not always just the raw number that you need to understand, but the story of the number can be found in [Why you can’t compare cross browser execution times of Selenium Tests](http://blog.dynatrace.com/2011/04/11/why-you-cant-compare-cross-browser-execution-times-of-selenium-tests/)
