*   [Spinach](http://codegram.github.com/spinach/) is a Cucumber-esque BDD framework that was advertised on twitter as having ‘less regex magic’. Not sure if it has grown Se support yet, but I have no doubt that it will soon.
*   [Coping With Big C.I.](http://jamesbetteley.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/coping-with-big-c-i/) is full of stuff that is useful for even Small C.I.
*   [Sane AJAX Testing in Selenium](http://draconianoverlord.com/2011/10/14/sane-selenium-testing.html) uses ‘reintroduced page loading’ for what I would call a ‘latch’ but describes it better I think. Or at least differently.
*   [Testing an SVG game](http://sny.no/2011/10/svg-game.html) is yet again pushing the envelope towards full online game p0wnage with Se.
*   Alright. And for the two people who haven’t seen it already here is [Jason Huggins’ Angry Birds-playing Selenium robot](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/10/angry-birds-robot-mobile-testing.html)
*   [How to get faster Selenium test cases execution](http://www.bonitasoft.org/blog/tutorial/how-to-get-faster-selenium-test-cases-execution/) is about RC — but still worth the read. (And if Cybozu Labs’ XPath engine is so much faster than Google’s then why hasn’t the default been switched?)
*   Here are some [Browsermob Adhoc Queries](https://gist.github.com/1295440) for after you have done your Se-based load run(s)
*   Why would you care about Fabric? Well, you have to get the code up and running on the server don’t you? In 1.3 you now have [Parallel execution](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.3.0/usage/parallel.html) available to you.
*   This [Interacting with new Developers…](http://people.gnome.org/~michael/data/2011-10-13-new-developers.pdf) deck is making the rounds.
*   [Selenium WebDriver tips](http://aleetesting.blogspot.com/2011/10/selenium-webdriver-tips.html) includes how-to-do-basic auth with is something I don’t think I have seen yet.
