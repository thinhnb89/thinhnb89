It’s catch-up time again! Here is the first 10.

*   [Automated tests for HTML5 offline web applications with Capybara and Selenium](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/04/29/automated-tests-for-html5-offline-web-applications-with-capybara-and-selenium) shows how a custom Firefox profile lets you automate Offline capabilities of HTML5 apps
*   Robot Framework’s [SeleniumLibrary 2.7 has been released](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/wiki/ReleaseNotes27) primarily to pick up 2.0b3 of the Selenium Server.
*   There was a series of posts about using Selenium with Drupal recently.
    *   [Selenium testing in Drupal](http://ygerasimov.com/integrating-selenium-to-drupal-simpletest-framework)
    *   [Run Selenium tests in Drupal on Debian headless](http://ygerasimov.com/run-selenium-tests-drupal-on-debian-headless)
    *   [Drupal Selenium tests API](http://ygerasimov.com/drupal-selenium-tests-api)
*   [Using XPath Axes for locating elements in Selenium](http://unmesh.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/using-xpath-axes-for-locating-elements-in-selenium/) discusses some of the more advanced ways of finding elements via XPath
*   I’ll follow that up with a link to the [cssify](https://github.com/santiycr/cssify) project which will attempt to automatically convert XPath locators to CSS
*   And since we’re now onto CSS… [CSS Stress Testing and Performance Profiling](http://andy.edinborough.org/CSS-Stress-Testing-and-Performance-Profiling) discusses the [stress-css](https://github.com/andyedinborough/stress-css) bookmarklet. Which you can integrate into your Se scripts using a trick I discuss [here](http://element34.ca/blog/dom-monster-and-selenium)
*   [VMTH (Virtual Machine Test Harness)](https://github.com/gregretkowski/vmth/) seems like another thing to put into the automated deployment toolkit
*   [GTAC 2011](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2011/04/gtac-2011-cloudy-with-chance-of-tests.html) has been announced — seems to be moving away from the hard-core automation geekery that it was when it started.
*   WatirGrid [can haz Selenium](http://altentee.com/blogs/2011/watirgrid-1-0-6-released-can-haz-selenium/) if you want a different model of browser distribution and are using Ruby. Naturally, [Gridinit also supports both now](http://gridinit.com/public/examples)
*   If you are using Jenkins, [Video recording, slides of “Securing Jenkins” webinar](http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/04/tgif-gift-video-recording-slides-of.html) could be useful viewing
