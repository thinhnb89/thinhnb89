Last week we quietly released Selenium IDE 1.0.12 on the website. It has Firefox 5 support along with other improvements. See the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/SeIDEReleaseNotes) and [unofficial announcement](http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2011/06/23/selenium-ide-v1-0-12-is-now-here/). Download it [here](http://seleniumhq.org/download/) or ask Firefox to check for plugins updates.

And for those who did not download 1.0.11 (it was not pushed through the update system) you will want to [read about the formatter change](http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2011/06/10/does-selenium-ide-v1-0-11-support-changing-formats/) that landed.
