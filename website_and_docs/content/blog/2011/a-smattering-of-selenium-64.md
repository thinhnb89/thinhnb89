How did I fall behind again already?!?!

*   This is a pretty good deck. [Automation Isn’t All Shiny Toys](http://speakerdeck.com/u/jimholmes/p/automation-isnt-all-shiny-toys)
*   If your work is divided in time-based goals then providing videos of the end result is a fantastic idea. See Dave’s [Q3/2011 in review](http://blargon7.com/2011/10/q32011-in-review/). The last two screencasts directly relate to Se
*   [The training wheels came off](http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off) is outstanding! I’ve been saying this around Se-IDE for years.
*   If you have tried automation-in-anger with Python, then you have likely spent some time swearing at the GIL. Thankfully David Beazley finds the GIL ‘fun’ and has posted some slides about it. [here](http://www.dabeaz.com/talks/EmbraceGIL/EmbracingGIL.pdf) and [here](http://www.slideshare.net/dabeaz/in-search-of-the-perfect-global-interpreter-lock). Such geeky fun.
*   Feature Switching is an important concept to get your development team wrapped around if doing automation; [Feature switching: a better way to collaborate](http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/feature-switching-a-better-way-to-collaborate.aspx) even has a common project feature-switch-inated linked to at the end.
*   Another important thing is hosting your own respository of build artifacts. [Repository? That’s not a repository](http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/10/repository-thats-not-a-repository/)
*   [Logging Selenium 2 Events in Twist](http://twist4all.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/logging-selenium-2-events-in-twist/) is a product centric spike report — but is a good read if you want to extend WebDriver
*   This ‘Learn your tools’ reminder is brought to you by [diving down the stack](http://blakesmith.me/2011/10/14/diving-down-the-stack.html)
*   Automated configuration management with Puppet? [Geppetto](https://github.com/cloudsmith/geppetto) seems to be an important addition to that toolset.
