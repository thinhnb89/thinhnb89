All opinions, all the time…

*   It all began with [Test Design for Automation](http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=325) which lead to [Automated Test Design (riffing/ripping off Alan Page)](http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/automated-test-design-riffingripping.html)
*   And then through some weird Jedi mind control there was [Design for \*GUI\* Automation](http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=332) which in turn led to [more UI test design (once more from Alan Page)](http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/more-ui-test-design-once-more-from-alan.html)
*   And heck, why have two articles from the same author when you can have three?! [It’s (probably) a Design Problem](http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=342) — though I don’t think Chris has riffed off this one yet…
*   Remember, [Not Every Test Should be Automated!](http://blogs.telerik.com/jimholmes/posts/11-09-22/not-every-test-should-be-automated.aspx)
*   [Dependency Injection Is NOT The Same As The Dependency Inversion Principle](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/22/dependency-injection-is-not-the-same-as-the-dependency-inversion-principle/) — not that I really understand either really…
*   Who knew a collection of scrapebookers is called a ‘crop’? Also, a ‘scrapbooking consultant’? — automation is hard, let’s go scrapbooking! Anyways, [Taking on Water](http://blog.aclairefication.com/2011/09/taking-on-water/) is dead on in terms of which things to prioritize when automating.
*   [Improving the Maintainability of Automated Test Suites](http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/autosqa.pdf) by Cem Kaner is an older paper, but the Strategies for Success on page 3 are important. Especially 1, 2 and 5.
*   Also from the vaults is [Harold’s Corollary to Knuth’s Law](http://cafe.elharo.com/testing/harolds-corollary-to-knuths-law/) which is aimed at Unit not Functional tests, but still is food for thought.
*   [Why Continuous Deployment Matters](http://www.benmgreene.com/post/9295282784/why-continuous-deployment-matters)
*   [The Little Black Book on Test Design](http://thetesteye.com/blog/2011/09/the-little-black-book-on-test-design/) is meant for exploratory testing, but I bet there is stuff one could pull out of it for automation purposes as well.
