Well, since the last Smattering there hasnâ€™t been much in the community. Oh. Well, except for hitting the 2.0.0 milestone. Which seems like a good time to remind people that:

*   _Selenium_ is the project _name_
*   Selenium _1_ is a project _version_
*   Selenium _2_ is a project _version_
*   Selenium _Remote Control (RC)_ is an _API name_
*   Selenium _WebDriver_ is an _API name_
*   A person _upgrades_ from Selenium 1 to Selenium 2
*   A person _migrates_ from RC to WebDriver

And with that soap boxing, here are some links for your consumption.

*   [Run Cucumber with Selenium RC and a custom Firefox profile](http://blog.enricostahn.com/run-cucumber-with-selenium-rc-and-a-custom-fi) actually is using WebDriver not RC, but shows a valuable trick regardless.
*   Iâ€™ve linked to these slides before, but this is a very important talk by Kent Beck on the sort of business changes that need to happen in order to enable Continuous Delivery.
