  Two Smatterings in two days?!!?

Two Smatterings in two days?!!? That never happens. Well, except when I get behind and have a metric tonne of links queued up.

*   Next week appears to be Meetup week with ones in [London](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/events/25582321/) on Tuesday, [Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Selenium-Meetup-Group/events/25352281/) on Wednesday and [San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/events/25062091/) on Thursday. Itâ€™s like we coordinated or something. (But didnâ€™t.)
*   Last monthâ€™s SFSE meetup was on framework design. Here is the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/saucelabs/test-automation-framework-designs) and the video.

*   [Selenium Smells](http://blog.magneticreason.com/?p=230) goes on a bit of a rant (and provides solutions) to people putting sleeps in their code instead of proper synchronization. For the record, this is the _first_ thing I do when Iâ€™m auditing peopleâ€™s Se code.
*   Se isnâ€™t really designed for the â€˜look and feelâ€™ aspect of automation, but [Selenium test for computedStyle](http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/11/06/28/selenium-test-computedstyle) a way to do it.
*   Using Watir and want to use the new Opera driver? Its easy-peasy according to [Using Opera with Watir-Webdriver (for free)](http://watirmelon.com/2011/07/08/using-opera-with-watir-webdriver-for-free/)
*   Whatâ€™s a Smattering without some crazy geek thing that helps you learn your tools better? [\_\_slots\_\_](http://mypythonnotes.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/__slots__/). There you go.
*   More build pipelining â€” this time with Jenkins. [Our Jenkins Build Pipeline setup](http://www.multunus.com/2011/07/continuous-delivery-using-jenkins-build-pipeline/)
*   [Nobody Understands REST or HTTP](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/07/03/nobody-understands-rest-or-http.html) could be added to me required reading list.
*   Read the last paragraph of [of 404s, automation and other things](http://perze.blogspot.com/2011/07/of-404s-automation-and-other-things.html). Now read it again.
*   Mozilla practices what it preaches in terms of the Open Web as discussed in [These are your tests: Testing in the Mozilla Ecosystem](http://marlenacompton.com/?p=2342)
*   [Insulating against failure using Caching Reverse Proxies](http://www.grahambrooks.com/blog/?p=407) just seems like a good idea.
*   [Web devs optimistic over IE10 conditionals drop](http://www.thinq.co.uk/2011/7/7/web-devs-optimistic-over-ie10-conditionals-drop/) seems to be something we-who-deal-with-browsers-and-their-quirks-for-a-living need to be aware of
*   In a weird bit of timing [A Selenium and Python appetizer](http://andialbrecht.de/blog/2011/07/12/a-selenium-and-python-appetizer.html) came out mere hours after [Getting Started With Selenium WebDriver on Ubuntu/Debian](http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/07/python-getting-started-with-selenium.html). For some reason, this [quote](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/22602.html) comes to mind. ðŸ™‚
