Will today be the day I finish three weeks of catch-up? Well, no..

*   [UI Tests – putting it all together](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/12/16/ui-tests-putting-it-all-together/) summarizes the series of posts using Watir and Cucumber, but the ideas could be converted to Se pretty easily.
*   I haven’t read it, but [Essential Software Testdesign](http://www.ryber.se/?p=213) is now available for free \[legitimately\] as a pdf. Test Design is something I expect to see more discussion around in 2011 when it comes to Se automation. The rules really are different here.
*   Missed GTAC 2011 but want to be there vicariously? Now you can! [GTAC #5: videos, slides, abstracts](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2010/12/gtac-5-videos-slides-abstracts.html)
*   Removing -htmlSuite from the Selenium Server and replacing it with a ‘real’ runner is something I’ve been thinking about recently after seeing [\[PROPOSAL\] Webdriver Selenese HTML Runner](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=175). Who else has done this? Let’s see/share the code.
*   I was babbling on about Page Objects on Twitter and was sent a video on ‘BDD, ATDD and Page Object’. Haven’t had time to see it yet, but you might.  
    
    [John Ferguson Smart](http://vimeo.com/18223672) from [Mohinder Khosla](http://vimeo.com/user4352894) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).
    
*   [Selenium Zoetrope](https://launchpad.net/selenium-zoetrope) is a PHP Se runner that will also record a video of your script’s run.
*   [The Economist: Testing Drupal using Selenium](http://codebaboon.com/economist-testing-drupal-using-selenium) is an experience report about the project that zoetrope originated in.
*   [The elements of (cucumber) style](http://testingwithvision.com/2011/01/04/the-elements-of-cucumber-style/) is a nice ‘style guide’ you could consider adopting for your Cucumber scripts.
*   Another [Selenium Auto Accept Self Signed SSL Certificates and Basic Authentication](http://agilesoftwaretesting.com/?p=143) post, but this time with a Ruby bias for those who insist on having SSL turned on in environments other than production. (WHY?)
*   And from the same person, [Testing PDF files with (and without) Selenium](http://agilesoftwaretesting.com/?p=166) which is outstandingly cool. I know of at least one client who needed this a year ago.
