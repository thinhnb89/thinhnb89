‘These are the people in your neighbourhood…’

*   Like the power of WebDriver, but not the API? [Watir WebDriver](http://watirwebdriver.com/) will get you going with the Watir API. Lots of useful stuff there.
*   So does Alister Scott’s [WatirMelon](http://watirmelon.com/) blog
*   [Sikuli Plays Angry Birds on Google Games](http://sikuli.org/blog/2011/08/15/sikuli-plays-angry-birds-on-google-games/) — just because scripts that play games are fun.
*   [cukeforker](https://github.com/jarib/cukeforker) is for ‘Forking cukes and VNC displays.’
*   First time I’ve seen a group of machines referred to as a ‘fleet’, but its appropriate. [http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/09/oneiric-server-deploy-server-fleets-p1/](http://cloud.ubuntu.com/2011/09/oneiric-server-deploy-server-fleets-p1/)
*   [SpecRun](http://specrun.net/) bills itself as ‘a smarter integration test runner for SpecFlow’
*   [ifttt](http://ifttt.com/wtf) (if this then that) looks like a love child of sikuli and yahoo pipes
*   A TextMate bundle that formats JSON strings? Sure! [A TextMate Bundle for JSON That Formats Properly](http://christopherroach.com/2010/12/17/json-textmate-bundle/)
*   Improve your Perl by making it look like Python with [Acme::Pythonic](http://search.cpan.org/~fxn/Acme-Pythonic/lib/Acme/Pythonic.pm)
*   Binding News
    *   New driver – [AutoIt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/blueducksda/)
    *   [Selenium::Remote::Driver](https://metacpan.org/module/Selenium::Remote::Driver) isn’t new, but is now in CPAN
    *   New driver – [Go](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/DEX7gVVSmjE)
