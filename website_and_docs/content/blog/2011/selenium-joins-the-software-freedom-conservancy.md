It doesn’t seem that long ago that we announced on the mailing list that the Selenium project planned to join the [Software Freedom Conservancy](http://sfconservancy.org/). I’m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We’re now under the aegis of the SFC.

From most people’s perspective, this won’t make much difference: you’ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from [Selenium HQ](http://seleniumhq.org). Development will continue to use [Google Code’s](http://selenium.googlecode.com/) code hosting and issue tracking. We are now, however, part of a formal non-profit organization, which means that a number of issues, such as how to handle revenues from adverts on our sites, become clearer and more transparent.

There are more details about what this means in the [SFC’s announcement](http://sfconservancy.org/news/2011/feb/02/selenium-joins/ "Selenium Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy") and their list of [membership benefits](http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/ "SFC Member Project Services"). The bottom line is that this is a major milestone in Selenium’s growth and ensures that as we continue to grow our user base and introduce new features and projects, we’ll have strong support and backing from a well-respected Open Source organization.
