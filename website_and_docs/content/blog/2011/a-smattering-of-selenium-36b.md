Second in a week-long series of catch-up posts. But before I get to the next batch of links, don’t forget to submit your proposals to speak at the first [Selenium Conference](http://www.seleniumconf.com/). I’m pretty sure we’re going to be trying to pick out the talks next week.

*   Can we _please_ adopt this as [the official poster](http://www.geneticanomaly.com/RPG-Motivational/slides/lawfulevil.html) for Selenium? Please?
*   If you are a C# developer looking to get started with Selenium WebDriver, [Automated Testing with Selenium 2 and NUnit](http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/automated-testing-with-selenium-2-and-nunit/47) seems like a good place to start
*   Per the who ‘bringing order to the universe’, [Watir-WebDriver: A detailed introduction](http://watirmelon.com/2010/12/14/watir-webdriver-a-detailed-introduction/) shows how to drive Watir using Selenium WebDriver
*   [UI Automation: Tricks and Traps](http://www.mathpirate.net/log/2009/12/23/ui-automation-tricks-and-traps/) has, well, umm, tricks to try and traps to avoid. Shocking. I know.
*   JUnit’s @Rule stuff is pretty serious magic, but really interesting. Here is [Using Rules to Influence JUnit Test Execution](http://cwd.dhemery.com/2010/12/junit-rules/) and [What JUnit Rules are Good For](http://cwd.dhemery.com/2011/01/what-junit-rules-are-good-for/)
*   Some more information on how to use the Flash ExternalInterface is in [Interaction with Flash using Selenium and Javascript – Part 2](http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/12/interaction-with-flash-using-selenium-and-javascript-–-part-2/)
*   xvfb and cucumber collide in [Running Cucumber Features Without a Display](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2010/12/17/cucumber-without-a-display/)
*   Use Lisp and want to use Selenium? Now you can with [selenium-lisp-connector](https://github.com/asdr/selenium-lisp-connector)
*   Looks like AutoIT3 might have some competition in the ‘drive native windows on Windows’ space with RAutomation. Here is how to [Automating Windows and Their Controls With Ruby](http://www.itreallymatters.net/post/2352350743/automating-windows-and-their-controls-with-ruby)
*   In what could be the best project name since ‘Vlad the Deployer’, [Zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/) is being touted as this week’s Selenium killer.

And now I’m off to drive through lake effect snow to get to [CodeMash](http://codemash.org) to stress out about my Selenium and Agile Testing workshops. Ah, the life of a consultant is certainly glamorous.
