In keeping with our (roughly) weekly releases, Selenium 2.8 was [released today](http://seleniumhq.org/download/) (and on Maven too), [with a \*huge\* list of bug-fixes](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG)!  As well as improved stability, if you’re using the Java API, this release adds the ability to upload files to a RemoteWebDriver server (see [RemoteWebDriver.setFileDetector](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#setFileDetector(org.openqa.selenium.remote.FileDetector))).

Particular thanks have to go out to our two newest committers, Alexei Barancev and Ajay Kemparaj, for the copious bug-fixes they’ve contributed!

We’re already hard at work getting 2.9 ready for next week with even more more bug-fixes – watch this space!
