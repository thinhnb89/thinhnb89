No. Really. I’m almost caught up.

*   Want input in a non-english language but don’t want to convert your whole machine? [InputKing](http://inputking.com/) might be able to help. And the fact it is in a browser means we can use it via Se.
*   HAR (HTTP Archive) is the format the cool kids are talking about, and now there is a [har gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/har) so you can make use of HAR files in you \[Ruby\] scripts.
*   Organizing scripts by tagging them is one bandwagon I got on last year to great success and while I don’t really live in the MS toolset, [Test Categories for MSTest](http://blog.simontimms.com/2011/01/test-categories-for-mstest.html) is likely how how I would do it MSTest.
*   Selenium won an award! Again! See [the video of Se winning ‘Best Open Source Functional Automated Test Tool’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7aQbi2N0g)
*   How a script is named is a reflection of the person who wrote it, in [Unit Test Naming Convention](http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/unit-test-naming-convention/) one such style is described and the reasoning explained. Just ignore the second half of the summary’s first sentence though.
*   Michael Larson is Working his way though [Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools Beginners Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/selenium-1-0-testing-tools-beginners-guide/book) and documenting it in a series of blog posts he is calling [a practicum](http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/search/label/PRACTICUM)
*   Most people use Se to create a regression security blanked, but it there are some points to be discussed around [the arrogance of regression testing](http://investigatingsoftware.blogspot.com/2010/12/arrogance-of-regression-testing.html)
*   ATDD continues to mature and the results of two different pattern workshops [have now been posted](http://www.managing-expectations.com/?p=1326). If you are using Cucumber, RobotFramework, Fitnesse, etc. you might want to pay attention.
*   It always saddens me a bit when large threads pop up [on how to manage Se scripts](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&srchtype=discussedNews&gid=961927&item=38882290&type=member&trk=EML_anet_ac_pst_ttle). It’s called version control kids. But I realize I’m an outlier on this.
*   I suspect a lot of Se folks have a similar tale to [How I Learned To Code](http://blog.abakas.com/2011/01/how-i-learned-to-code.html)
