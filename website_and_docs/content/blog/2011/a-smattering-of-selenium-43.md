*   The big thing in the new last week was ColdFusion. Yes, ColdFusion. I was amazed how much mention it got on Twitter.
    *   [Introducing CFSelenium – A Native ColdFusion Client Library for Selenium-RC](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2011/2/22/Introducing-CFSelenium--A-Native-ColdFusion-Client-Library-for-SeleniumRC)
    *   [Export Selenium-IDE Scripts in CFSelenium (ColdFusion) Format](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2011/2/23/Export-SeleniumIDE-Scripts-in-CFSelenium-ColdFusion-Format)

    *   [CFSelenium and VirtualBox](http://thecrumb.com/2011/02/25/cfselenium-and-virtualbox)
*   [SeleniumCamp](http://seleniumcamp.com/) happened over the weekend and from the looks of things was a success. And had almost an [even number of women as men](http://twitpic.com/4403rt) — which is almost unheard of at these sorts of things. David Burns [posted his thoughts on it](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2011/selenium-camp-slides-and-thoughts.html) and slide decks are starting to make it online now; [search for #seleniumcamp](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23seleniumcamp) for the ones I have missed.
    *   [BDD approach with Selenium RC](http://www.slideshare.net/kolesnik_nickolay/bdd-approach-with-selenium-rc)

*   A cool trick to get coverage number if you are using IIS is shown in [Code Coverage of ASP.NET Applications On IIS](http://docs.ncover.com/how-to/code-coverage-of-asp-net-applications-on-iis/) — so how does one do similar for other web stacks?
*   [Adding a \[URL\] attribute to the \[Browser\] attribute for xUnit.net](http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/benadderson/archive/2009/09/10/74787.aspx) is a post I’m having a hard time summarizing, but seems pretty cool.
*   [UI testing your EPiServer site with Selenium and SpecFlow](http://www.popkram.com/blog/2011/02/ui-testing-your-episerver-site-with-selenium-and-specflow/) is another how-to post.
*   [Amount of profanity in git commit messages per programming language](http://andrewvos.com/2011/02/21/amount-of-profanity-in-git-commit-messages-per-programming-language) is just fun.
