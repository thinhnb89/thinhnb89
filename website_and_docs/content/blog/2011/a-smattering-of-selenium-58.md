And here we go again with more links than I thought I had collected…

*   There are a metric tonne of site on the internets which are on how to scam your way through a Se interview. [Hiring Selenium QA people](http://paulhammant.com/2011/08/04/hiring-selenium-quality-assurance-peope/) provides some fodder on how one could look for and hire Se folk.
*   [Why I don’t use spork](http://silkandspinach.net/2011/08/08/why-i-dont-use-spork/) reminds us that pain is \[sometimes\] a good thing.
*   The Jenkins project is [having a conference](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-user-conference) on October 2 in the same hotel that SeConf was held.
*   [So long, farewell, and thanks for all the automation lessons learned (or: o hai beautiful Page Object Model AMO Selenium tests!)](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/stephend/archives/2011/08/today_our_legac.html) could win the prize for the longest title ever. And has a good lessons learned section at the bottom.
*   [Selunit](http://www.selunit.org/) lets you run your Selenese inside something like Jenkins
*   ATDD is still ‘the next big thing’, but [Raconteur](http://raconteur.github.com/) seems pretty darn cool. If I worked in C# that is…
*   From Agile 2011 we have
    
    **[Continuous Integration, the minimum viable product](http://www.slideshare.net/simpsonjulian/continuous-integration-the-minimum-viable-product "Continuous Integration, the minimum viable product")**

    View more [presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/) from [Julian Simpson](http://www.slideshare.net/simpsonjulian)
    
    Pay close attention to the database section. I’m getting more and more convinced that this is the part that most companies can benefit the most from.
    
*   [How to get the args of a function in Python](https://gist.github.com/1138485) is one of those geeky things that is super helpful and likely a smell that you are trying something you shouldn’t be at the same time.
*   [Is your test automation actually agile? A Guardian Content API example.](http://www.investigatingsoftware.co.uk/2011/08/is-your-test-automation-actually-agile.html) is part two of one linked in the last Smattering. And the last paragraph is so full of win.
*   Our friends at Watir have [released Watir 2.0](http://watir.com/2011/08/11/watir-2-0/). Congrats!
*   I’ve not tried to run Cucumber in Jenkins, but [explains how to do it](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2011/08/09/running-your-cukes-in-jenkins/) should you have need
*   More people should [make logos out of lego](http://blog.mozilla.com/dolske/2010/12/15/firefox-is-made-of-lego/).
*   ![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/1WvaZ.jpg)
*   [Waiting for elements when UI-testing with WebDriver and EPiTest](http://www.popkram.com/blog/2011/08/waiting-for-elements-when-ui-testing-with-webdriver-and-epitest/) explains a bit about the WebDriverWait class and has _The road to UI-testing hell is paved with Thread.Sleep_ which would get it linked to in any event.
*   One thing that keeps getting brought up around WebDriver is ‘how do I get the http code of a request?’. The short answer is you don’t. The long answer is you have to do something like [HOWTO: Collect WebDriver HTTP Request and Response Headers](http://www.supermind.org/blog/968/howto-collect-webdriver-http-request-and-response-headers)
*   [How Cadence Predicts Process](http://www.leanessays.com/2011/07/how-cadence-determines-process.html) reminds people to look at all parts of the process when speeding things up
*   When building frameworks or DSLs it is useful to know how to make things as deprecated. [deprecatable](https://github.com/copiousfreetime/deprecatable) is one way to do it in Ruby
*   [Exploratory Testing in an Agile Context](http://testobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ETinAgile-agile2011-final.pdf) is another session handout from Agile 2011.
*   [#Selenium Tales from the road part 1 – Artifact Naming and Organization](http://bornagainagilist.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/selenium-tales-from-the-road-part-1-artifact-naming-and-organization) describes one way of organization your Se stuffs. That you need a convention I think is exactly why you should use dynamic suites via tags, but…
*   The PyCon US 2012 [Call for Proposals](http://us.pycon.org/2012/cfp/) is now out.
*   [Continuous Deployment of iOS Apps with Jenkins and TestFlight](http://blog.shinetech.com/2011/06/23/ci-with-jenkins-for-ios-apps-build-distribution-via-testflightapp-tutorial/) describes how to build iOS apps in Jenkins (and if you want, pushing them up to TestFlight)
*   Why oh why am I only just discovering [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) which makes Python’s urllib2 usable.
*   [How to be a faster writer](http://www.slate.com/id/2301243/pagenum/all/#p2) isn’t about writing scripts or code, but its ideas are still sound.
*   I pretty much refuse to read anything in ACM format, but [On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf) could be of interest to someone without my biases.
*   [An Inside Look at the GIL Removal Patch of Lore](http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html) is the geekiest bit of writing I’ve read all month.
*   I had forgot how much I enjoy purpose built sites like [Is the internet down?](http://istheinternetdown.com/)
*   I did a webinar on Page Objects the other week for which [the video is now available](http://www.pushtotest.com/create-robust-selenium-tests-with-pageobjects). Its not embeddable, but there is at least a link around the registration wall above the form.
