Now that Selenium 2 has [been released](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/), one of the goals of the project is to provide regular updates to our users and the community. The aim is for these updates to be small and manageable, incrementally addressing issues and problems raised by you. Selenium 2.1, which is [launched today](http://seleniumhq.org/download/), marks the first of these regular, small releases.

[Selenium 2.1](http://seleniumhq.org/download/) is largely focused on improving Grid with a host of minor improvements including better tracking of “orphaned” browser instances. There are also some bug fixes in the Firefox and IE WebDrivers, particularly when dealing with elements that are _just_ off screen, and in making the Selenium RC emulation in the Java bindings more robust when confronted with pages that haven’t started loading.

As you can see, this is a “bite size” release, but we’d love to know: would you prefer these small, swift releases or larger ones? Please answer in the comments, or on the [mailing list](groups.google.com/group/selenium-users)!
