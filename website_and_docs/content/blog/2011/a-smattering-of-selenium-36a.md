I have drastically fallen behind on the link reporting, but not the collecting, so this weekâ€™s Smattering will be multi-part.  
  
The â€˜bigâ€™ news falls for this edition is two fold â€“

1.  Weâ€™re having a conference! [Selenium Conference 2011](http://www.seleniumconf.com/) is April 4 â€“ 6, 2011 in San Francisco. See the site for more information. (And I think our friends at Watir are going to be in the same space the day before.)
2.  The Betas are here! The Betaâ€™s are here! As Simonâ€™s [post](/blog/2010/selenium-2-0-beta-1-release/) announced, Selenium 2.0b1 has been released to the \[unsuspecting\] masses. Everyone, including Se-RC users are encouraged to switch their server over to it â€” its backwards compatible with 1.x and has a tonne of important fixes (like the HEAD request on open, -htmlSuite works again, etc.)

And not to downplay things, but here are the usual assortment of things I think are of interest/value to those automating stuff \[with Selenium\].

*   Checklists are a Good Thingâ„¢ when it comes to testing, so why not automation too? So here is a [Unit Test Review Checklist](http://www.bryancook.net/2010/12/unit-test-review-checklist.html)
*   ExtJS is one of those things that seems to come up more often than not on the se-users list which makes me think Iâ€™m lucky that none of my clients use it. [Testing Extjs Application With Selenium : Few Pointers](http://amiworks.co.in/talk/testing-extjs-application-with-selenium-few-pointers/) seems like it would be useful in such an event though.
*   Those of us around the automation space for awhile have often heard about Googleâ€™s mythic â€˜Small, Medium, Largeâ€™ scheme for categorizing scripts â€” and now [they are documented](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html). Combining this idea with tagging of scripts and youâ€™re laughing.
*   Looks like IBM is now starting to care about Selenium in developerWorks with [Automated web testing with Selenium](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-webautoselenium/index.html) which has an assortment of quick things to help people out. And it is IBM so it got lots of love from folks \[bots?\] on Twitter.
*   Personas is something from the UX community that Iâ€™ve started to think more about in terms of what gets automated and/or how the the scripts are organized. The [Persona Cheat Sheet](http://www.uxbooth.com/resources/persona-cheat-sheet/) will help you start down that road too.
*   [Testing Experience](http://www.testingexperience.com/index.php) magazine recently had an Open Source issue which had some interesting articles. Doesnâ€™t appear to be anything groundbreaking, but my definition of that might be a bit warped.
*   Oooo! All of this yearâ€™s [GTAC videos](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1242F05D3EA83AB1) in one place. Now you really can pretend you were in India for the week.
*   [Go faster! Linking data generation to hotkeys](http://trishkhoo.com/?p=272) is one of those posts that could be quite useful if you use automation to move quickly around a site so you can manually test it.
*   Selenium IDE 1.0.10 is a â€˜stableâ€™ version (unlike 1.0.8 and 1.0.9 it seems) but did introduce one change to how element attributes are handled which I documented in [Atoms have come to Selenium IDE](/blog/2010/atoms-have-come-to-selenium-ide/)
*   Using Pythonâ€™s unittest module? Consider upgrading to [unittest2](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/unittest2.shtml)
