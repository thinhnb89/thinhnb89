…in which I also date myself.

*   CITCon is another one of those conferences I should go to but haven’t. Yet! [7 continuous integration ideas from CITCon](http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/11/7-continuous-integration-ideas-from.html) is a quick list from the most recent iteration.
*   [Testing Facebook authentication with Rails 3 Cucumber, Capybara, Selenium](http://www.cowboycoded.com/2011/05/06/testing-facebook-authentication-with-rails-3-cucumber-capybara-selenium/) has a nice little trick to get Facebook to authenticate back to your Rails stack.
*   [pennyworth](https://github.com/heavywater/pennyworth) is a ‘continuous packaging system’ which seems like an interesting description.
*   [Acceptance Tests With JBehave, Selenium & Page Objects](http://blog.m.artins.net/acceptance-tests-with-jbehave-selenium-page-objects/). We need more examples of how to do Page Objects in ways that align with the runner’s model of the world.
*   [When to Wait with Webdriver](http://www.decipherinc.com/n/blog/development-and-engineering-team/2011/11/selenium-tests-when-wait-webdriver) walks through getting synchronization working. I like that implicit waits are just a middle step.

*   I’ve been thinking about Code Kata’s recently, and here is a [Code Kata with DDT in JUnit](http://qatraveller-diary.blogspot.com/2011/11/code-kata-with-ddt-in-junit.html). We need, as a community, to come up with some of these for Se.
*   In somewhat sad news, Bromine which is \[was\] powered by Se is [ending development](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=f7d92e9509336c1ea1b4f3506&id=14c245e9a8)
*   [Orders of Magnitude in Test Automation](http://www.agilejournal.com/articles/columns/column-articles/6460-orders-of-magnitude-in-test-automation) proposes some smell tests to determine if you are overly heavy in one type of automation or another
*   Want to make a Python decorator but feel you might be inventing the wheel? [PythonDecoratorLibrary](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary) \[currently\] lists 31 different decorator implementations so you don’t actually have to reinvent that wheel. Unless you want to of course…
