  Aside from one of the dog’s tummy making noises that imply a big mess to clean up later, this scheduling thing seems to be working out.

Aside from one of the dog’s tummy making noises that imply a big mess to clean up later, this scheduling thing seems to be working out.

*   Heard someone talk about doing bitmap comparisons last week somewhere. [Adaptive Images](http://adaptive-images.com/) tricks I suspect are going to become more commonplace. Good luck with that. Se is best at interaction, structure and content checks; not does-it-look-the-way-some-human-intended. Robots where robots should be used. Humans where humans should be used.
*   [Interacting with a Javascript confirmation from Selenium](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/9929935317/interacting-with-a-javascript-confirmation-from) in Cucumber
*   [Converting Selenium waitForCondition to WebDriverWait](http://www.tarnowski.se/2011/09/11/converting-selenium-waitforcondition-to-webdriverwait/) sends you along the path to understanding Waits in WebDriver
*   [Splinter](http://splinter.cobrateam.info/) seems like a wrapper about the Python WebDriver bindings
*   [Making a Mockery of TDD](http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/06/making-a-mockery-of-tdd/) starts with _To be a successful mockist, you must dislike mocks._ which I think is just as important when doing Se. The res of the article is good too.
*   [Integration Testing with RSpec, Capybara, and Selenium](http://jumpstartlab.com/resources/testing-ruby/integration-testing-with-rspec-capybara-and-selenium/) includes this gem
    
    _Integration tests **can** be brittle if they know too much about how those components work. Proper integration tests use your application as a black box. They should know as little as possible about what happens under the hood, they’re just there to observe and interact with the interface._
    
*   I seem to think I already posted this, but the search isn’t finding anything. Here is a visualization of the commits to Se.

*   The [GoogleWebmasterHelp](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleWebmasterHelp) channel on YouTube is full of ideas that you could include in your scripts. At least from an SEO perspective. And Google SEO at that.
*   The theme this week seems to be GIL. So here is [About concurrency and the GIL](http://merbist.com/2011/10/03/about-concurrency-and-the-gil/) which for once is about Ruby.
*   The whole ‘Facebook switching from Watir’ thing produced at least one good rebuttal; [Facebook, Watir And Testing](http://itreallymatters.net/post/10991877834/facebook-watir-and-testing)
