I think the word that I’m looking for is “wow”. Perhaps “Wow!” would express the concept a little more clearly. Perhaps “WOW!” would be even clearer.  Yes, definitely. “WOW!” is a good way of describing [this](http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2011/02/09/).

Before Christmas, Opera Software announced a [pre-release of OperaWatir](http://my.opera.com/core/blog/operawatir-pre-release), an implementation of the Watir 2 API. What you may not know is that Watir 2 rests on the same WebDriver core as Selenium 2. Today, Opera made the source of the [OperaDriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver) available on github: [https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver)

This is “WOW!” It’s the first time a browser manufacturer has released their own implementation of the WebDriver APIs, and it shows how much Opera values test automation. Selenium 2 users now have an easy way to test that their sites work with [Opera](http://www.opera.com/products/).
