My scheme for catching up with links last week ran afoul of 900 geeks and their families melting the internets at [CodeMash 2.0.1.1](http://codemash.org). So let’s try it again this week.

*   Capturing screenshots on script failure is a common trick and [Capturing Web Page Screenshots with Selenium 2](http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/capturing-web-page-screenshots-with-selenium-2/48) is the first post I have seen that explains how to do with with Selenium WebDriver
*   [XPath marks the spot](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/01/selenium-xpath-marks-the-spot/) uses a treasure map analogy around how to create good XPath — but at the same time propagates the ‘XPath is Inherently Evil’ myth. I intentionally don’t link to myself nearly as much as I could, but think that my comment in the post is important.
*   [Unit Test Patterns: The Domain Test Values Class](http://manbuildswebsite.com/2010/12/20/domain-test-values/) describes a pattern to _provide values used in the testing of a domain in a way which improves understanding of test code by increasing readability and adding meaning to values._
*   [leakhelper](https://github.com/tlrobinson/leakhelper) is another of those tools that could be cool to integrate into your Se scripts. And if you do, don’t forget to document it and point it out to me…
*   [Missiles + Failed Builds = Bamboo Punisher](http://blogs.atlassian.com/devtools/2010/12/missiles-failed-builds-bamboo-punisher.html) — actually, its a crazy high level of awesome
*   [Software Testing Lightning Talks from IWST](http://www.michaeldkelly.com/archives/548) includes some on automation at the end — but lots of good non-automation ones as well
*   [Testing SmartGWT Applications with Selenium and Robot Framework](http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/12/testing-smartgwt-applications-with-selenium-and-robot-framework/) is more Robot Framework goodness including _Add some meaningful ID’s to your code_ — which is actually for SmartGWT but makes life so much easier
*   The author of Selenium Simplified compares his book to Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools in [So now you have a choice of Selenium Testing books and ebooks](http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2010/12/29/so-now-you-have-a-choice-of-selenium-testing-books-and-ebooks/) is a pretty fair and well-reasoned article. (Short version: buy both)
*   We can’t go a couple months without someone rediscovering the joys of sending text to the browser. This time it is [Functional testing with Selenium: issues with selenium.type, javascript events and keyPressNative](http://blog.projectdirigible.com/?p=671) but has the additional twist of including a solution in code and not just whinging.
*   If you are a .NET developer, then [Selenium Toolkit for .NET 0.84 Released](http://www.bryancook.net/2011/01/selenium-toolkit-for-net-084-released.html) might be of interest.

And assuming I remembered to pay the internet bill, there will be more links tomorrow.
