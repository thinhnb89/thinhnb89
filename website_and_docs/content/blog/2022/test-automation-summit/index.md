  An event to improve contributions to and collaboration among open source WebDriver based projects
---

Have you ever wanted to contribute to an open source testing project, but couldn't figure out where to start?
If so, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6u6_bS59njqhhSwfnWSlGxlqQaNJ8xouDBR6YM-7pQYvJFQ/viewform)
to apply for an invitation to join the Open Source Test Automation Summit on August 26 in Berlin,
sponsored by [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) and hosted by [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).
You can review the list of available projects below and select the one that you'd like to contribute to. We'll be in touch soon if you
are selected to join us.
<br/>

**Update 7/22/2022:**
Application deadline is July 28! We'll contact everyone by Friday, July 29.

This will ***not*** be your typical workshop.
This will be a working session with one or more maintainers of a given project
to show you exactly what you need to know to contribute to that project.
Selected participants will be required to bring a laptop capable of executing Selenium tests,
including a working dev environment for the applicable programming language.

This is a new idea weâ€™re trying out, so space is very limited.
If there is sufficient demand we will consider doing more events like this in the future.

### Objectives

At the end of the session you will be able to:
* Build the project on your computer
* Execute the existing test suite for the project
* Write new tests for the project
* Add a feature or fix a bug

### Agenda (subject to change)
