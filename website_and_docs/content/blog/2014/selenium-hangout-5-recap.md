**0:00 – 01:10** Intro

**1:11 – 13:00** [WebDriver W3C Spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) & Selenium 3 Update

*   Progress on the spec, still a work in progress
*   No user facing changes to the Selenium API as a result
*   Trying to pair the spec and Selenium 3 together
*   If all goes well, the spec and Selenium 3 could drop during Selenium Conf (fingers crossed)

**13:01 – 24:10** [Selenium Conf 2014](http://seleniumconf.org/) Update

*   Check out [the new and shiny conference site](http://seleniumconf.org)
*   Dates posted (e.g., call for talk submissions, early bird tickets going on sale, etc.)

**24:11 – 39:00** Discussion about 5 Hidden Costs Of Selenium Whitepaper from Telerik

*   [David Burns’ blog post rebuttal](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2014/dont-write-five-hidden-costs-of-x-but-when-you-do-i-will-reply.html)
