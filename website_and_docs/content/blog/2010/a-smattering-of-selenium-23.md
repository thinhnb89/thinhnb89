I was at Agile 2010 in Orlando last week so missed doing the Smattering, so here is two weeks worth of links.  

*   There is crazy amounts of power hiding in that there JUnit 4 library – such as @Rule. One usage of them is [described here](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2009/10/04/junit-rules/). A useful pattern indeed when doing something like BDD or ATDD
*   The next [SFSE has been announced](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14320878/); August 24 at LinkedIn. Se creator Jason Huggins will be fielding questions in a _Q&A session on steroids_.
*   While on topic of meetups, [Dawn](http://passionatetester.com) will be presenting about Selenesse at [Agile Carolinas](http://agilecarolinasaugust2010.eventbrite.com/) also on the 24th
*   iCheckWebsite is an accessibility monitoring site which is a niche that I haven’t seen exploited yet. What is interesting is [their checklist of what they check for](http://www.icheckwebsite.com/feature). Looks like a great start for a suite of Se tests.
*   Se plays a large part in Continuous Deployment setups, but what I am really interested in is Continuous Delivery. Jez (who literally wrote the book on it) explains [the difference between the two](http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/).
*   One of the better sessions I went to at Agile last week was [Mountains to Molehills: A Story of QA](http://tourdedave.com/i-came-i-saw-i-spoke-at-agile-2010/) that featured some Se content so gets included here.
*   [Setting up flex testing with selenium](http://mariangemarcano.blogspot.com/2010/08/setting-up-flex-testing-with-selenium.html) – with Selenium Flex API and FlashSelenium
*   [Selenium 2/Web Driver – the land where Page Objects are king!](http://www.wakaleo.com/blog/279-selenium-2web-driver-the-land-where-page-objects-are-king) is the winner of the ‘most twitter love for the last two weeks’ award.
*   Samit continues to churn out plugins for Se-IDE, this time with the [Log Search Bar Plugin](http://reallysimplethings.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/log-search-bar-plugin-for-selenium-ide/)
*   The Bromine kids have released a bit of a case study on the Roskilde Festival and CI in [Continuous integration of the orange feeling](http://blog.brominefoundation.org/2010/07/continuous-integration-of-the-orange-feeling/)
*   Ooo! [A completely useless tool competition!](http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/index.php?option=com_jforms&view=form&id=10&Itemid=183) – Vote Selenium!
*   [Web Automation Framework](http://sourceforge.net/projects/webauthfw/) claims to integrate Selenium, TestNG, ReportNG, SimpleXML, Java, Sikuli, Flash-selenium — which is an interesting fruit salad as it lists apples, oranges, bananas and pears when comparing things.
*   I hate to pimp my own stuff, but [Six Shocking Automation Truths](http://softwaretestpro.com/Item/4859/Six-Shocking-Automation-Truths/Automation-Best-Practices-Software-Test-Professionals-Conference) did fairly well from page view perspective. It even spawned a well thought out [response/reaction.](http://discoveredtester.blogspot.com/2010/08/my-take-on-adam-gouchers-six-shocking.html)
*   Again, sorry to have my stuff in here, but if you are wondering what Page Objects are (and how to implement them in Python) then my article [Page Objects in Python](http://www.pragprog.com/magazines/2010-08/page-objects-in-python) from the August issue of PragPub is what you need.
*   Managing Se-Grid machines is a pain (which is why you have companies like Sauce Labs coming into the fray. Another option is to use Copper from GridCentric to have [Elastic Build Systems](http://blog.gridcentriclabs.com/2010/07/elastic-build-systems.html)
*   One of the Se 2a6 new features was the Web Timings API which David experiments with in [Automating the Capture of Web Timings with Selenium 2](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/selenium-webtimings-api.html)
*   Parallelism is kinda (but not really) solved by Se-Grid, but when you start specing out machines, do you need more [threads or cores – and do you know the difference?](http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/thread-cores-which-you-need.aspx?dgc=SM&cid=57468&lid=1479422)
*   Robot Framework is growing Flash/Flex support; the status of which can be see in [this email from the flex-pilot mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/flex-pilot/msg/ef60fcadab56fc8e?pli=1)
