The big news for last week was that I released Se-IDE 1.0.8 to very little fanfare. 1.0.9 should be a week or two and much more important a release.  

*   [Cheesecake!](http://seleniumexamples.com/blog/examples/cheesecake/) is isn’t nearly as impractical as Pacman, but still adds to the Se2 example bucket.
*   The London Se Meetup stuff from last week are starting to appear…
    *   [Client-side profiling with Se2](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/london-selenium-user-group-3.htm)
    *   [a summary](http://blargon7.com/2010/11/mozilla-in-london-for-selenium-meetup-3/)
    *   [How Mozilla uses Se](http://www.slideshare.net/stephendonner/selenium-londonmeetup-5671730)
    *   [Crowd-sourced Automated Firefox UI Testing](http://www.slideshare.net/hskupin/crowdsourced-automated-firefox-ui-testing)
*   [Some notes from CITCON](http://www.dafydd.net/archive/2010/continuous-deployment/) last week as well. Seems like London was the place to be.
*   When designing automation frameworks (internal or external), the list of ways to [make it hard to misuse](http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/index.cgi/tech/2008-03-30.html) should be kept in the back of your mind.
*   Of course your automation is under version control, right? RIGHT?!? [What the Commit](http://whatthecommit.com/) is rather amusing, if not a scathing satire. (hint: hit refresh)
*   Sauce Labs announced the availability of [a CI API](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/doing-continuous-integration-testing-check-out-our-ci-api/). But there is nothing to say that you couldn’t integrate their [alternative annotation methods](http://saucelabs.com/products/docs/sauce-ondemand#alternative-annotation-methods) outside of CI too.
*   Harry Robinson did a session at CAST 2010 on ‘Exploratory Test Automation’ (which I missed; no, not bitter at all..) and I [found his slides](http://869789182725854870-a-harryrobinson-net-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/harryrobinson.net/www/ExploratoryTestAutomation-CAST.pdf)
*   If you are using the hosted Bamboo solution and most of your Se tests need windows, then here are instructions [on how to create your own custom elastic agent image](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Creating+a+Custom+Elastic+Image)
*   Here is something fun, do you [Hate](http://amplicate.com/hate/selenium) or [Love](http://amplicate.com/love/selenium) Se?
*   [Slate](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slate) seems like an interesting module for Python folks since it can parse and extract information from PDFs which is often a black hole in automation.
*   I continue to maintain that automation is programming (much to the annoyance of the classical black-box tester who is starting out with it) and that perhaps the easiest language to start learning is Python. [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/home) is a new book which looks like an ideal way to learn the language. I haven’t really gone through it to see which parts are more (or less) relevant to automation, but…
*   [You’re cuking it wrong](http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong) has lots of tips on how to write Cucumber scripts well.
