12 hours late, but I was driving draft horses all day so that’s my excuse and I’m sticking with it. Enjoy. I’m going for a nap.  

*   The big news this week was the [next alpha of Se 2 came out](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/selenium-2-0a5-released/). Time to update those automation machines.
*   Like TestNG’s @BeforeClass and @AfterClass but using JUnit4? [Using JUnit Nested Suites with Selenium RC to simulate TestNG suite and grouping annotations](http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2010/07/17/using-junit-nested-suites-with-selenium-rc-to-simulate-testng-suite-and-grouping-annotations/) is a long titled post, but describes how to fake one out to act like the other.
*   Also on the topic of TestNG is the announcement of [Selenium on TestNG](http://www.nabeelalimemon.com/blog/2010/07/selenium-on-testng/)
*   The folks at ActiveState did a survey in their community about tooling and [Selenium won](http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/07/survey-says-selenium-nose-most-popular-test-framework)
*   I had to hack DNS a bit for a client’s Se setup to work the other week, but that seems pretty kludgey compared to [Selenium Trick: Using a different DNS](http://twasink.net/blog/2010/07/selenium-trick-using-a-different-dns/)
*   Using ExtJS? According to [Testing ExtJS with Selenium Automating UI Tests](http://www.jslog.com/testing-extjs-with-selenium-automating-ui-tests) the trick is to use CSS as your location strategy
*   Jason Huggins was interviewed by Matt Heusser in [Episode 3 of TWiST](http://www.softwaretestpro.com:80/Item/4832)
*   If you are doing Se, then you are doing code. If you are converting ‘classic’ manual testers to do automation you need to start thinking about [Training Testers in how to code…](http://deancornish.blogspot.com/2010/07/training-testers-in-how-to-code.html)
*   While not directly related to Se, [Practicing Continuous Integration on Flash Projects: Using Hudson](http://blog.nobien.net/2010/07/19/practicing-continuous-integration-on-flash-projects-using-hudson/) is the wrapup post in a series on doing what it says. If you are doing CI, and of course _everyone_ is, then it needs to be for all parts of your system
*   [ParkCalc automation – Keyword-driven tests in FitNesse](http://blog.shino.de/2010/07/18/parkcalc-automation-–-keyword-driven-tests-in-fitnesse/) wraps up the series by Markus Gärtner that has been mentioned the last two weeks as well.
*   [HOWTO: Test JQuery AJAX autocomplete menus with Selenium](http://blog.buberel.org/2010/07/howto-test-jquery-ajax-autocomplete-menus-with-selenium.html) details something that is fairly common I think.
