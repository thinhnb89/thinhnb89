A bit late, but I’m in California for a Selenium Developers Meetup and my body doesn’t quite know where it is temporally.  

*   Don’t forget that tomorrow is the next meeting of the [San Francisco Selenium](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14320878/) folks which seems to be running a crowd sourced “Let’s stump Jason with our problems” session. Most of the ‘main’ Se folk will be there.
*   Test design theory is something that I have yet to really see covered much, so here are three articles on the similar idea of what to test and what to skip.
    *   [Contradiction: Test Everything, but not Accessors?](http://xprogramming.com/articles/contradiction-test-everything-but-not-accessors/) by Ron Jeffries
    *   [don’t test for blocking conditions: an example](http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/dont-test-for-blocking-conditions.html) by Chris McMahon
    *   [Every automated test should do ONE thing really well](http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1087) by Adam Goucher (me)
*   [Another simple build radiator](http://motivatedautomator.blogspot.com/2010/08/another-simple-build-radiator.html) is just a darn cool re-skinning of Hudson which, while not as fun, is super useful in communicating build status
*   Simon started to explain some of the work going on in the guts of Selenium WebDriver in [Going Atomic: Why?](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/going-atomic-why/)
*   For those people who loiter in the #selenium irc channel, you have likely seen ‘selbot’ in action. If you wondered where it came from you can read the details from Sauce Labs in [Introducing selbot](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/08/introducing-selbot/)
*   Atlassian is a pretty big user of Se and has a post called [push my buttons](http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2010/08/selenium_push_my_buttons.html) which explains the myriad of ways you can send a key in Se 1.x. Which IIRC is one of the major improvements that Se 2 provides.
*   The march of Flex Pilot continues and so the blog posts from users are starting to appear including [Selenium Testing with Flex Pilot](http://mariangemarcano.blogspot.com/2010/08/selenium-testing-with-flex-pilot.html)
*   I was pleading for help on twitter last week and this [cool use of the JUnit 4 @Rule annotation to get screenshots on test failures](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seuenium.com.br%2F2010%2F01%2F04%2Fcapturando-a-tela-com-o-selenium-e-junit%2F) was provided
*   If you are using CruiseControl.NET then [Integrating Selenium Tests into CruiseControl.Net via NUnit](http://multitiered.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/integrating-selenium-tests-into-cruisecontrol-net-via-nunit/) is likely going to deliver value
*   [Silverlight UI testing with Selenium and Ruby](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/louissalin/archive/2010/08/22/silverlight-ui-testing-with-selenium-and-ruby.aspx) is the first article I think I have seen on the subject. Of course, my memory isn’t so hot at time…
