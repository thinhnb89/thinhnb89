Happy [Simcoe Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graves_Simcoe). Only a handful of links this week to mention.  

*   Kevin relaunched [Mogotest](http://mogotest.com) – _see your website the way your users do._
*   In a much earlier Smattering I think I linked to an announcement about a Se talk at Boston.rb. Well, [here are the slides](http://blog.darnowsky.com/2010/07/27/slides-from-selenium-presentation-at-bostonrb.html)
*   While not directly related to Se, the W3C has released their Unified Validator called, wait for it, [Unicorn](http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/). So who is going to create the integration that magically sends pages to be validated there?
*   ‘Ad Hoc Workflows’ appears to be a plugin for Confluence, and is a user of Se. They released a video last week of their [tests in action](http://www.adhocworkflows.com/display/WWW/2010/07/23/How+we+use+Selenium+to+test+Ad+hoc+Workflows). (Make sure to have you volume up for the great soundtrack)
*   The exploration of Se 2 and Ruby gets even deeper with [Adding automation to your Selenium 2.0 tests (Ruby)](http://mountaintroll.blogspot.com/2010/07/adding-automation-to-your-selenium-20.html) – oh, and RSpec and Rake.
*   Michael guest posted on this blog on [How to use Selenium 2 with Maven](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/) which was a bit of a mystery as we internally changed how thing work around Maven but forgot to really communicate that.
*   Sauce Labs is having a webinar this Thursday on [Cloud-Based Web Application Testing for Adobe Flex and Flash](https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/244624344). Register now, etc.
*   [Selenium browser UnitTesting from TeamCity](http://kristjansson.us/?p=947) is full of XML and C# that I’m sure would make sense to people familiar to TeamCity
