Iâ€™ve got a full day of driving ahead of me to go to a client so this is the early-morning (for me) edition of the Smattering post. That of course means there will be an absolute link explosion in about 20 minutes.  

*   [Dave](http://seleniumexamples.com) talks about some of the stuff he is doing with Se-IDE in the post [Improving Selenium IDE](http://seleniumexamples.com/blog/improvements/improving-selenium-ide/)
*   Another post on how to deal with [file downloads in Se](http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/07/file-downloads-with-selenium-mission-impossible/). Mission Impossible no more
*   [Hue Doj](http://code.google.com/p/hue/) got some tweet love as another possible locator strategy for Se. So who wants to write the integration?
*   Iâ€™m really starting to enjoy JUnit 4. [Ben](http://www.testjutsu.com) has been learning about it too and shares [Data driven Selenium in JUnit via @Parameters](http://www.testjutsu.com/data-driven-selenium-in-junit-via-parameters)
*   [Fake.app](http://fakeapp.com/) also got some twitter love. It looks nice, but drag-and-drop script creation and Mac only will ultimately limit its growth capability
*   There was a contest around the test management system, TestRail. What is cool though is the [API](http://code.gurock.com/p/testrail-miniapi/) that they have for it that allows external script engines report into it. Itâ€™s all about the integrationsâ€¦
*   The Bromine project has released [new screencast](http://brominefoundation.org/cast/Bromine.html) which showcases Sauce OnDemand and Hudson integration. And it is a really slick integration at that.
*   [Dawn](http://passionatetester.com) is [interviewed on DZone](http://java.dzone.com/videos/video-agile-testing-and) about Agile testing and SeleNesse (the Se / Fitnesse bridge)
*   [High level acceptance testing in your PHP applications using Python, Lettuce and Selenium](http://www.franciscosouza.net/2010/07/high-level-acceptance-testing-in-your.html?spref=tw) is a mini tutorial on umm, well, High level acceptance testing in your PHP applications using Python, Lettuce and Selenium
*   [Hudson Ci Server Running Selenium/Webdriver Cucumber In Headless Mode Xvfb](http://markgandolfo.com/2010/07/01/hudson-ci-server-running-cucumber-in-headless-mode-xvfb) is another well named post
*   If you are using FarCry, [testMXUnit](http://farcry.posterous.com/testmxunit-farcry-testing-framework-supports) will take a Selenese script and convert it to a format it needs
*   [Programmatic testing with Selenium and TestNG](http://www.javauc.com/java/2625) is a nice post that discusses TestNG, DbUnit, and Cargo
*   Se-IDE Plugin: [Stored Variables Viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/189780/) â€“ _This plugin allows you to view these variables when the test is running._
*   Another post from Markus GÃ¤rtner on a European Weekend Testing session on automation with RobotFramework; this time titled [ParkCalc automation â€“ A short reflection](http://blog.shino.de/2010/07/05/parkcalc-automation-a-short-reflection/)
*   [Syn JS](http://github.com/pinhook/funcunit/tree/master/synthetic) claims to provide proper click events for Se 1.x scripts. It was only [soft launched](http://groups.google.com/group/javascriptmvc/browse_thread/thread/ccd73cf4bcd65c5) but expect more from these folks in the near future

And lastly, BrowserMob, which was started by Se Core member Patrick Lightbody announced that [it has been acquired by Neustar Webmetrics](http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/07/browsermob-joins-neustar-webmetrics-family-of-services/). Congrats! Now stop drinking the champagne and get back to work! ðŸ™‚
