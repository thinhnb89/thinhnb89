It’s Labour Day here, so this post was written to backdrop of Sponge Bob. In case you were wondering.  

*   [selenium-java-evidence](http://code.google.com/p/selenium-java-evidence/) appears to be another logging framework, this time with an emphasis on auditability. Personally, the reports from a CI server should be all that are required, but to each their own…
*   [taza](http://wiki.github.com/scudco/taza/) is _an opinionated browser-based test framework_
*   [webdry](https://bitbucket.org/niklasl/webdry) is _a Python (jquery-inspired) wrapper for DRY:er access to the Selenium WebDriver_
*   [Self-testing AppEngine apps with Saucelabs](http://github.com/jsa/blogy/blob/master/gae-saucelabs.md) seems like a cool little (if very low level) trick to using Se inside AppEngine
*   Sauce Labs released their [Getting Started With Selenium](http://saucelabs.com/docs/quickstart) guide and is looking for feedback on it
*   Need to interact with a web service during a BrowserMob run? [Hybrid BrowserMob Scripts](http://element34.ca/blog/hybrid-browsermob-scripts) explains how to do it.
*   [Self-Verifying Page Objects](http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=343) is Patrick Wilson-Welsh’s first post in the series patterns that made up his and [Dawn](http://passionatetester.com)‘s Agile 2010 session.
*   Felipe is starting to explore Se and TestNG (which is timely for me) starting with [Using TestNG to launch your tests (and the Selenium server)](http://knorrium.info/2010/08/31/using-testng-to-launch-your-tests-and-the-selenium-server/)
*   Hudson create Kohsuke Kawaguchi did a webinar for Sauce Labs on using [Hudson with their OnDemand service that was recorded](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/recorded-webinar-kohsuke-kawaguchi-demos-using-hudson-with-sauce-ondemand/). I haven’t watched it yet, but it looks like it has general Hudson and Se information as well.
*   Se’s CSS support got and overhaul this week as [Sizzle replaces CSSQuery](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=9590) as the way of finding things via the CSS locator. Sizzle is the CSS engine that powers JQuery.
*   [JBehave 3.0 has been released](http://tw-oss.blogspot.com/2010/08/jbehave-30-released.html) – for those who use it
*   Simon wrote another technical piece on some of the inner workings for Se2 in [Going Atomic: How](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/going-atomic-how/)
