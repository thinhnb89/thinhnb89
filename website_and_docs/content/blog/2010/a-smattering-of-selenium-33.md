…and here’s the links!  

*   Henrik Skupin was one of the speakers at the London Selenium Meetup and has [written about the night and his talk](http://www.hskupin.info/2010/11/19/mozmill-crowd-talk-at-selenium-meetup-3-in-london/)
*   Speaking of which, [videos of the talks are now up](http://www.youtube.com/user/londonselenium/)
*   Part of good automation is knowing how to code. So here are some sites that crossed my path this week for that
    *   [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/)
    *   [Dive into HTML 5](http://diveintohtml5.org/)
    *   [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/)
*   Cheezy continues his UI series which takes a detour over to WATIR land, but things are transferable. [Introducing a Simple DSL](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/19/ui-tests-introducing-a-simple-dsl/) and [Default Data](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/21/ui-tests-default-dat/)
*   Functional Automation is an important part of Continuous Delivery. Here is Jez talking about [Continuous Delivery](http://carlfk.blip.tv/file/4397842) — beer in hand. (which to me is the most important concept of the year)
*   [Acceptance Test-Driven Development with Robot Framework](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/ATDDWithRobotFrameworkArticle) is an excerpt from Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development.
*   [BidiChecker](http://code.google.com/p/bidichecker/) is a tool for checking bidirectional (BiDi) text. So who is going to integrate this into Se?
*   [Interaction with Flash using FlashSelenium and Javascript – Part 1](http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/11/interaction-with-flash-using-flashselenium-and-javascript-part-1/) starts to show how to use FlashSelenium to interact with Flash-y things.
*   Looking for a Selenium job? Have a look at [How to get a Rails job](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2010/11/how-to-get-a-rails-job/). When I have hired, or help people hire, this is very true.
*   And finally the whole should-testers-need-to-know-how-to-code conflict bubbled up again somewhat last week. Since this is my list of links: if you are automating, yes; if you are not, then no (but it can’t hurt).
    *   [Don’t call me Technical](http://a-sisyphean-task.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-call-me-technical.html)
    *   [The Future of Testing](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/the-future-of-testing/)
    *   [The Future of Testing is Wide Open](http://blog.testyredhead.com/2010/11/18/the-future-of-testing-is-wide-open.aspx)
