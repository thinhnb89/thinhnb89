I’ve missed a couple weeks due to travel and a complete system lock which meant I lost all the links I had open but not saved. So these are the ones I have recovered.

*   I have written a series of posts on how to do parallel execution of tests in JUnit 4 up on the Sauce Labs blog. [Part One](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/parallel-junit-4-and-selenium-part-one-parameters/), [Part 2](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/parallel-junit-4-and-selenium-part-two-external-properties/) and [Part Three](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/parallel-junit-4-and-selenium-part-three-parallelism-and-ondemand/)
*   [Quick start with FitNesse and Selenium](http://radomirml.com/2010/10/21/quick-start-with-fitnesse-and-selenium) is a beginners guide to wiring Selenium and FitNesse together. Though it might have been easier to just use [Selenesse](http://github.com/marisaseal/selenesse)
*   Meetup: [Test Automation Tips, Techniques and Best Practice – Ruby and Java night](http://www.meetup.com/Quality-Assurance/calendar/15152685/) in NYC, November 8
*   [Commit 10000](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=10000) for the Se project. That’s a non-small number
*   If you are using Maven 3, you can now use the [Selenium Plugin](http://olamy.blogspot.com/2010/10/maven-selenium-plugin-11-maven-3.html) with it now.
*   [Do Testers Have to Write Code?](http://testobsessed.com/2010/10/20/testers-code/) applies to Se as well.
*   [Multiple Sessions in Cucumber & Selenium](http://tristandunn.com/2010/10/21/multiple-sessions-cucumber-selenium.html) got a fair bit of twitter love and is something I’m seeing clients want/need more and more
*   [A Set of Principles for Automated Testing](http://a-sisyphean-task.blogspot.com/2010/09/set-of-principles-for-automated-testing.html) is not a bad list. I completely disagree with the second one, and the last one is blatant employer promotion (but is contextually correct).
*   [RSpec best practices](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2010/10/testing/rspec-best-practices) is a similar list which I have less complaint about. The third point is likely the most important one.
*   [Multiple Sessions in Cucumber & Selenium](http://tristandunn.com/2010/10/21/multiple-sessions-cucumber-selenium.html) is a solution for when you are testing something with WebSockets with Cucumber.
*   [NUnit 2.5.8](http://nunit.org/?p=releaseNotes&r=2.5.8) is out.
*   Dale Emery has released [Runtime Suite](http://github.com/dhemery/runtime-suite) which is super handy for creating test suites at runtime with JUnit 4. It doesn’t (yet) work with parameterized classes, but is still pretty cool
*   [Feed4JUnit](http://databene.org/feed4junit.html) seems to have don’t some of the legwork for people to do parameterized JUnit scripts. (Yes, I’ve been stuck in Java-land for the last while; why do you ask?)
*   As Flex Pilot gets more usage, things are starting to trickle out into the blogs. [Automating MyAppInFlex.swf – Useful FlexPilot commands](http://mariangemarcano.blogspot.com/2010/10/automating-myappinflexswf-useful.html) is one of those posts.

Oh, and both 2.0a6 and 2.0a7 have been released. We’re getting closer to the ‘API freeze’ which will mark the end of ‘alpha’ and the start of bug fixing (beta) for the final release.
