A fair number of links this week. The vast majority of which were buried in annoying airport internet advertising frames…  

*   This looks like it is Spanish which would normally mean it doesn’t get included but it [Integração Selenium e Testlink](http://sembugs.blogspot.com/2010/10/integracao-selenium-e-testlink.html) explains how to integrate Se with TestLink. We, as a community, need to document this sort of thing more.
*   [JUnit 4 Vs TestNG](http://www.mkyong.com/unittest/junit-4-vs-testng-comparison/) is a somewhat biased comparison between JUnit 4 and TestNG; but useful none the less.
*   Hot on the heels of last week’s SFSE is the announcment of [Learn to Test Your SproutCore Apps with Lebowski Framework](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14966653/) for the month of October.
*   [Behaviour Driven Development With JBehave Web 3, Selenium and Maven 2 on OS X Snow Leopard](http://siark.wordpress.com/2010/10/01/behaviour-driven-development-with-jbehave-web-3-selenium-and-maven-2-on-os-x-snow-leopard) is, aside from very buzzword compliant, the first thing I’ve seen using Se and JBehave.
*   [Bi-Testual: Coming out of the Software Closet](http://marlenacompton.com/?p=1877) is something a lot of people in automation grapple with. Am I a tester who programs? A programmer who tests? Something entirely new?
*   Using Selenese and want to use Sauce OnDemand? [Absolute Beginners Guide to Running Sauce RC with HTML Scripts](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/absolute-beginners-guide-to-running-sauce-rc-with-html-scripts/) is for you.
*   While combing the Sauce Labs blog, I noticed my [How To Minimize The Pain Of Locator Breakage](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/how-to-minimize-the-pain-of-locator-breakage/) has been published.
*   Page Objects are ‘in’ to say the least these days. [Writing page based tests with selenium in ruby](http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/writing-page-based-tests-with-selenium-in-ruby/) is just enough to get you down the path of page objects in ruby.
*   And because we can’t have only one post on Page Objects, [Step-by-step selenium tests with page objects, dsl and fun!](http://luizfar.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/page-objects/) is in Groovy
*   [Cheatsheet: Creating mocks in PHPUnit](http://www.oliverklee.de/temp/mocking-cheatsheet.pdf) could be useful for those who write Se scripts in PHP
*   The talks for GTAC 2010 [have been announced](http://www.gtac.biz/selected-talks). I don’t know what the pool of talks they pulled from was like, but I’m underwhelmed
*   I have no idea where [SeleniumWiki](http://www.seleniumwiki.com/) came from, but there is a fair bit of content there. Not sure how much is original and how much is lifted from other places on the internets — the spidey sense tingles when the title says ‘VB Code’ which seems to imply it is an SEO hunting site.
*   Martin Fowler’s DSL book is out Real Soon Now and the [first chapter is available online](http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1592379). Most people have been saying ‘build a DSL for your scripts’ for awhile — now we’ll see just how off all our definitions of that were.
*   getXpathCount is one of the more powerful commands in Se, but the bulk of people use it ‘wrong’. [Effectively using Selenium’s getXpathCount function](http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/09/effectively-using-seleniums-getxpathcount-function/) starts to address that problem.
