Not too much this week with various holidays around the world, but still managed to dig some things up.  

*   Sauce Labs has started [a webinar series](http://saucelabs.com./about/webinars) and recently had one on [using Cucumber and OnDemand](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/06/live-video-demo-using-cucumber-to-test-apps-in-the-cloud/). Cucumber and Robot Framework like tools are the coming wave of testing tools.
*   Another bit of Sauce-ish news is the folks at Rally put up [a post on how to get Se 2 scripts in their OnDemand cloud](http://www.rallydev.com/engblog/2010/06/29/sauce-ondemand-with-selenium-2-0-and-webdriver/)
*   If writing Se scripts is ‘programming’, then writing the controlling frameworks is _real_ programming. That means that proper development practices should be followed; such as TDD. If you are new to TDD, then The Prags have [released a screencast series by Kent Beck](http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development) would be helpful. I’ll be getting this one as soon as my to-watch backlog gets under control.
*   [Re-usable Selenium Testing with GWT](http://blog.ernster.co.uk/?p=15) has lots of tricks to dealing with GWT widgets — something which comes up a lot on the Se-Users mailing list

And lastly, the [Selenium Stack Exchange proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4693) has progressed to the next level which is getting people to commit to using it. The number of commits is a convoluted formula, but every one counts. If you think the Se-Users mailing list is too crazy, this format might be better for you.
