For those people paying attention to the goings-on in the Selenium world, yes, I am skipping something major until some of the details are worked out and announced. Until then, here are the links I accrued over the week.

*   Selenium uses Bamboo for its CI infrastructure. This week saw an upgrade to the latest version so if you want bleeding-edge code, [get it here](http://xserve.openqa.org:8085)
*   The only browser Se has no real traction on right now is the BlackBerry one. But if someone wanted to tackle it, here is a post from Atomic Object on [their BlackBerry development environment](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2010/11/04/our-blackberry-development-environment) that would help kickstart things maybe.
*   Under the category of ‘let the language deal with things’ is [html5lib for python and php](http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/) which will parse html. Sometimes it is far faster to dump your attribute checks etc. to a native parser than let Se do it.
*   Scott Sims has released [Selenium Fury](http://scottcsims.com/wordpress/?p=251) upon the Ruby world. Think of it as a Page Factory implementation for Ruby.
*   Using Se-IDE and Easyb? Here is a thread on how to [use the generated code without modification](http://groups.google.com/group/easyb-users/browse_thread/thread/0079b48526514a72/3a12e1d253d4b512?show_docid=3a12e1d253d4b512)
*   JRuby is one of the better languages to use to write Se scripts in, and here are [videos from JRubyConf 2010](http://www.engineyard.com/videos/JRubyConf%202010)
*   Cheezy is writing a series on UI tests. So far there is [How do we keep them from being brittle?](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/09/ui-tests-not-brittle/) and [Part Two](http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/13/ui-tests-part-two/)
*   Se2 for JS? Sure, why not. [webdriver-js](https://github.com/dmachi/webdriver-js)
*   Jari release the [selenium-webdriver 0.1.0](http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver) gem this week. Why the big jump from 0.0.29 to 0.1.0? We’ve merged in the selenium-client gem into the main selenium codebase and now there is a single gem if you want to do 1.x or 2.x scripting.
*   [Google Refine](http://mashable.com/2010/11/10/google-refine/) is just darn cool. I’m not really sure how it plays into automation, but I get the sneaky suspicion it could. Somehow.
*   The [YUI Test](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/09/introducing-the-new-yui-test/) has Se built right in.
