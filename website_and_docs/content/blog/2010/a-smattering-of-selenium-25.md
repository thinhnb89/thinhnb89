A day late, but that sort of thing happens when you have family.  

*   I keep telling myself I will document how to incorporate Se launching and result recording in QC, but never seem to find the excuse. Looks like Aaron found the excuse: [Finding the API for a DLL](http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/finding-the-api-for-a-dll/), [Connecting to HP/Mercury Quality Center from a client side script](http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/connecting-to-hpmercury-quality-center-from-a-client-side-script/)
*   Also from Aaron is a cool [Credit Card Generator](http://one-shore.com/aaron/gencc/) which has nice id tags which makes for easy Se parsing. Though I would argue that rather than open a new browser for this you send a URL get or similar, but this works as well.
*   [David](http://scannell.com) continues to post about his employer’s ‘Elastic Build System’ in the context of Se-Grid in [Nimble Test Clusters](http://blog.gridcentriclabs.com/2010/08/nimble-test-clusters.html)
*   Having had, and then mutually cancelling a book deal on Se, its a delight to see [Overview of Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools: Beginner’s Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/selenium-1-0-testing-tools-beginners-guide/book) now available in ‘beta’. Guess you need to finish it now, eh David?
*   [easy setup for your cucumber scenarios using headless gem run selenium your ci server](http://www.aentos.com/blog/easy-setup-your-cucumber-scenarios-using-headless-gem-run-selenium-your-ci-server) is in the context of cucumber, but could be easily ported to other things I suspect.
*   Another I-switch-to-Se2-and-liked-it post, this time from Ben at [Switching from Selenium 1.x to WebDriver/Selenium 2 and HtmlUnit](http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/benadderson/archive/2010/08/26/94208.aspx)
*   [howfuckedismydatabase](http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/) is just plain funny. And who of us hasn’t asked that very question – usually at some less than optimal time
*   The September gathering of Chicago ALT.NET is on September 8 and is going to be on [Selenium 101.3: Practical Functional Testing Techniques](http://chicagoalt.net/event/September2010Meeting-Selenium-101-3-Practical-Functional-Testing-Techniques)
*   [Testing Flash With Selenium](http://vrajasankar.blogspot.com/2010/08/testing-flash-with-selenium.html) talks about the standard ExternalInterface stuff, but most important is the last sentence: _So, if your app has less functions that needs to tested, you can use this approach, if not, testing manually will be the better option._. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should (more insight into the life of Selenium consultant…)
*   Another framework! This time it is [Selena](http://wiki.github.com/meza/Selena/).
*   An over-the-should problem-solution post on getting started with Se – [FMK vs Selenium](http://fmk.incipiatturba.net/2010/08/28/fmk-vs-selenium/). Worth also checking out the ‘Modeling Portfolio’ for the, erm, interesting hairstyles he has tried on himself
*   Seems like [Yeti](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yeti/) and Se should work well together, though I can’t quite figure out why/how. And for those with small kids, the [Yeti Stomp](http://youtu.be/8jPlzKNA0ZU) might also be familiar.
