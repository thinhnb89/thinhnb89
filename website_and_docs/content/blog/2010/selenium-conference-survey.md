Great news! Thanks to the initiative of our friends at [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com), we’re finally ready to host the first-ever Selenium Conference. We’re still working out a lot of the details, but so far we’ve decided this first conference will be sometime in April and hosted in San Francisco.

In order to figure out the rest of the details, we’re looking for feedback from the Selenium user community. Please take a moment to fill out the [following survey](http://bit.ly/fn8YyS). Your answers will help us properly plan the best possible conference.

Thanks!
