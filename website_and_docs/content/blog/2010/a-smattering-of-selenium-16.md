I’m going to start posting the Smattering posts here on the main Selenium blog, hopefully each Monday. For past ones see [my personal blog’s archive](http://adam.goucher.ca/?s=a+smattering)  

*   [Style Tests using Selenium and Robotframework](http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/06/style-tests-mit-selenium-und-robotframework) – _With those simple steps we are able to do regression testing on our user interfaces that have strict standards_
*   [Export Selenium IDE scripts for Grails](http://adhockery.blogspot.com/2010/06/export-selenium-ide-scripts-for-grails.html) – A plugin which does exactly what the announcement says.
*   [Selenium XML Formatter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/106193/) – Hurray for plugins!
*   [TestApi – a library of Test APIs](http://testapi.codeplex.com/) – Seems like it might be useful for people working in .NET land
*   [BlueDuck Selenium Remote Control](http://sourceforge.net/projects/blueducksrc/) – The folks at BlueDuck have packaged a release of Selenium RC with an installer and GUI for controlling options
*   [Selenium and Hippo CMS](http://wiki.onehippo.com/display/CMS7/Create+a+Selenium+test+case) – Its not a plugin — locators are next on the pluginification list — but if you are using Hippo CMS and want to use Selenium with it, this custom locator makes the integration easier.
*   [Checking for JavaScript Errors with Selenium](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2010/6/7/Checking-for-JavaScript-Errors-with-Selenium) – This is the coolest trick I have seen in quite a while!
*   [FlexMonkium](http://www.gorillalogic.com/flexmonkium), Gorilla Logic’s bridge between Selenium and their FlexMonkey product is now available in beta. Yup, its partly a plugin for Se-IDE. (Oh, and their [press release](http://eon.businesswire.com/portal/site/eon/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20100609005532&newsLang=en) has a quote which I think is the first time that has happened…)
*   Not to be outdone, Sauce Labs have announced [support for Flex and Flash as well](http://saucelabs.com/flex). Care to guess how it is implemented? A plugin…
*   Working with Joomla? You could recycle their [Test Case Methods](http://docs.joomla.org/Selenium_Test_Case_Methods) to automate some of your tasks. Creating product DSL-like helper wrapper things is exactly the right path to take.
*   [Pyrite](http://mintdigital.github.com/pyrite/) – _Easy peasy in-browser testing with Selenium_ (in Ruby)
*   Using [Sauce Labs OnDemand](http://saucelabs.com/products/sauce-ondemand) and [Hudson?](http://hudson-ci.org) The is [now a plugin for that](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Sauce+OnDemand+Plugin).
*   [Lebowski](http://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Lebowski) is _The test automation framework for SproutCore applications_ and uses Se at its core.
*   [Running Selenium Tests on Sauce Labs](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/running_selenium_tests_on_sauce) describes, well, how run Se test in On Demand (in Java).
