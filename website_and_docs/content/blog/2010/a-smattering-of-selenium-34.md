We’ll start this week with the [official announcement of ‘Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools: Beginner’s Guide’ being available](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/selenium-book-published.htm). Congrats David! (Still waiting for my copy…)  

*   There is now a [DZone ‘refcard’ for Selenium 2](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-selenium-20?utm_source=feedburner). Of course, the reason Se2 is alpha is the API isn’t done with at least one major addition still left so it will be out of date in a month, but still…
*   Here is [another example of how to do Page Objects in Python](http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/projects/socorro_qa/)
*   [Client-Side Profiling with Selenium 2](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/client-side-profiling-with-selenium-2.html) is David’s post about his recent London Selenium User Group talk
*   Someone took the time to make a [Selenium lens](http://www.squidoo.com/selenium-web-testing) on Squidoo; which is going to get kinda circular once this post shows up on it.
*   [Why Automated Testing is Broken](http://opineandwhine.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-automated-testing-is-broken.html). Not much of a commentary here other than A-freaking-men. Ok, that was commentary.
*   [Selenium Toolkit for .NET](http://seleniumtoolkit.codeplex.com/) got a version bump for the first time in a year.
*   [Driving a Flex Application via Selenium 2 WebDriver](http://blog.blackpepper.co.uk/driving-a-flex-application-via-selenium-2-webdriver/) shows how to use FlexSelenium and Web Driver together
*   RVM is one of the ‘cool kid’ tricks and [Continuous Integration with Hudson](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/integration/hudson/) is one of those things you need to know how to do if you are using it.
*   [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) appears to take RVM one (or more) steps further
*   I keep thinking someone needs to create a Selenium koans site. Inspired by [javascript koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) and [ruby koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)
*   [Launchlist](http://www.launchlist.net/) appeals to me somehow. Throw in an API for launching scripts and you have a nice TCM system
*   I spent some time figuring out how to integrate Robot Framework with Sauce Labs OnDemand and then [wrote about it](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/integrating-robot-framework-with-sauce-ondemand/)
*   [Web Driver for the BlackBerry](http://code.google.com/p/webdriver-blackberry/wiki/WebDriverOverview) – did not know that even existed.
*   [gocept.selenium](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gocept.selenium/0.3) is another Zope 2/Plone/ZTK integration
*   [BDD, ATDD and Page Objects](http://www.wakaleo.com/resources/presentations/306-bdd-atdd-and-page-objects) was a talk done at SkillsMatter which was recorded

Oh. and I just noticed that this is the Selenium-iversay edition of these things.
