Today we’re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released. While most 
of our efforts are on Selenium 2.0, we understand that there are millions of Selenium users that 
still need the 1.x line supported. That’s why we’ve said from the start that our goal is make 2.x 
100% backwards compatible with 1.x. And that’s why we’re releasing a new version of Selenium RC today.

In addition to many bug fixes, the biggest improvements in this version are support for both **Firefox 3.6 and OS X Snow Leopard**.
