(If I wasn’t still recovering from a cold there would be something witty here.)  

*   We’ll start this week with a [cartoon](http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/2010/08/20/the-system-408-bowser-testing)
*   So I know I have linked to [playing pacman with se 2](http://seleniumexamples.com/blog/examples/play-pacman-with-selenium-2/), but here is a site that [explains the ghost behavior](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior). If Google implemented the algorithms properly-ish, then this should be the ticket to crazy high scores. There should be a contest for this…
*   [Cucumber + Cuke4Duke + Selenium (WebDriver) = Enlightenment](http://terminalvelocity-socal.blogspot.com/2010/11/cucumber-cuke4duke-selenium-webdriver.html) is step-by-step instructions for using maven to wire all these things together.
*   [shell in a box](http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/) means you can now use Se to automate a unix shell
*   [How test automation with Selenium or Watir can fail](http://mattarcherblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/how-test-automation-with-selenium-or-watir-can-fail/) provides two code smells for automation
*   [UI test smells: if() and for() and files](http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2010/11/ui-test-smells-if-and-for-and-files.html) is a bit of a rebuttal with some additional commentary
*   [Surviving end-to-end-testing… or, using Selenium for fun and profit](http://rorygibson.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/xpday-2010-surviving-end-to-end-testing-or-using-selenium-for-fun-and-profit/) is a write-up of the XP Day session of the same name
*   _The first thing that really became obvious to is that the community has to stop thinking about the tools and step back to look at a wider picture of the processes that have evolved over the last decade. Tools are there to assist us with a process, so focusing on tools and not on the process is just causing problems in adoption for new teams._ is from Gojko’s article in the [December 2010 issue of The Tester](http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/tester-dec10.pdf). And is extremely important to remember given that this is a tool focused blog
*   Missed Øredev? [Watch the videos](http://oredev.org/2010/videos)!
*   A post from Sauce Labs shows [how to put messages](http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/test-videos-fun/) in your script runs. Crazy enough, I did [something similar](https://github.com/adamgoucher/selenium-hollywood).
