My. Get. Productive. I know! I’ll push out a smattering. Oh. …

*   [Python for Ruby Programmers](https://speakerdeck.com/mleone/python-for-ruby-programmers) is a pretty good deck, with the requisite snark at the end that you can safely ignore.
*   [Me @ Selenium Camp 2013](http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2013/03/03/Me-Selenium-Camp-2013) is Ivan’s mini-experience-report from SeCamp and has his slides on GhostDriver
*   Using pip in production? [pip install : Lightspeed and Bulletproof](http://tartley.com/?p=1423) is a useful trick which I know I’ve done variants of with java and ruby in the past
*   [SeConf speakers are up](http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/) — and the list looks really good
*   [Interfaces or Abstract Classes?](http://www.brandonsavage.net/interfaces-or-abstract-classes/) is marketing fodder, but its the best kind of fodder since its actually useful. For those of us still working through PHP.
*   I forgot about this semantic war in the whole three weeks since it happened…
    *   [The Insapience of Anti-Automationism](http://context-driven-testing.com/?p=69)
    *   [“Manual” and “Automated” Testing](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2013/02/manual-and-automated-testing/)
    *   [Manual Testing Does Exist and It Is Bad](http://xprogramming.com/articles/manual-testing-does-exist-and-it-is-bad/)
    *   [My two € on opposite terms](http://carstenfeilberg.blogspot.dk/2013/03/my-two-on-opposite-terms.html)
*   [Android UI Design Pattern in practice](https://speakerdeck.com/mathieu_calba/android-ui-design-pattern-in-practice-english-version) is not only useful, but I like the format…
*   [Continuous Deployment: The Dirty Details](http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/mbrittain-continuous-deploymentalm3public) – slide 18, 36, 42, 83, 102 are the killer slides. 102 is the killer-est slide and is where I would enter a semantic debate with the fine folks at Etsy over whether they are doing Continuous Deployment or Continuous Delivery
*   [Could CSS3 be making sites that are not testable?](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2013/could-css3-be-making-sites-that-are-not-testable.html) – New standards making the life of automators more incredibly hard? Never!
