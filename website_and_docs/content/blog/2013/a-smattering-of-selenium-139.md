Posting from the past into the future. Or something… (its a scheduled post).

*   [webdriverjs-with-jasmine](https://github.com/ericminio/webdriverjs-with-jasmine) appears appropriately named since it claims to be _A standalone (includes standalone Selenium server (30Mo) + includes Jasmine) working example of a test with WebDriverJS and Jasmine._
*   Similar to the above, but with Drupal and Behat – [Classic](https://github.com/sprice/classic)
*   [How I\[he\] send notifications to the build breakers.](http://twitter.yfrog.com/h3kgdcp) using twillio
*   [On Code Review](http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1569) comes from the Food For Thought department
*   [Orc](https://github.com/youdevise/orc) is a _model driven orchestration tool for the deployment of application clusters_. Sounds cool.
*   [upgrading hacked dependencies](http://searls.testdouble.com/2013/01/18/upgrading-hacked-dependencies/) — doncha hate when you do this?
*   [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) will tell you have well you do against their accessibility heuristics. Its no guarantee of course, but its a start.
*   And why is it no guarantee? See [Things I learned by pretending to be blind for a week](http://blog.silktide.com/2013/01/things-learned-pretending-to-be-blind-for-a-week/).
*   Dear SpeakerDeck; your embed method doesn’t work with WordPress. So here is a link to [So, You Want to Be a Front-End Engineer?](https://speakerdeck.com/dmosher/so-you-want-to-be-a-front-end-engineer)
*   I was bored and experimenting with Py.Test fixtures [here](https://gist.github.com/3921739) — and then got schooled in the comment section on how to actually do it.
