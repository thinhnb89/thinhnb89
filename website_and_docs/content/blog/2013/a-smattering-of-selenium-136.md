Someone go back to my past self and punch him for thinking that starting to get in shape was a good idea. OMGCANTMOVE.

*   [.NET Goes Immutable](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/01/Immutable-BCL) seems interesting. But I don’t really speak C# so it could very well be boring and uninteresting.
*   [Shadow DOM 101](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/) is another part of HTML5 that makes me think this web automation stuff has a very limited life span. Between this and Canvas… ugh.
*   [Using WebDriver to automatically check for JavaScript errors on every page](http://watirmelon.com/2012/12/19/using-webdriver-to-automatically-check-for-javascript-errors-on-every-page/) is something I have been considering adding to my frameworks…
*   Have I mentioned how much Canvas worries me? [Snow in canvas land](https://gist.github.com/4338551) is an interesting post on debugging/improving performance on an little canvas app
*   And in a similar vein, [Why moving elements with translate() is better than pos:abs top/left](http://paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/)
*   I want to say that I’ve already linked to this, but I need it for a potential project so I’m linking it again – [Modifying Python’s SimpleHTTPServer to accept directory aliases](http://www.huyng.com/posts/modifying-python-simplehttpserver/)
*   As a framework vendor I’m a bit worried about linking to [Why Frameworks?](http://blog.8thlight.com/myles-megyesi/2012/09/12/why-frameworks.html), but there you have it.
*   It both worries me, and impresses me, when people start needing to do [Linux TCP/IP Tuning for Scalability](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2012/linux-scalability/)
*   Living in the cloud? Go read [An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/10/2/an-epic-tripadvisor-update-why-not-run-on-the-cloud-the-gran.html). Now. The last link can wait.
*   [Understanding HEAD, HTTP/204 and HTTP/206](http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/blog/12-11-12/understanding-head-http-204-and-http-206.aspx) — What? You mean that there is more to HTTP than 200 and 404?
