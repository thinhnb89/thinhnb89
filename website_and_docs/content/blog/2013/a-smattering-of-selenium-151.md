Almost a month after the last one. Though it did nice to have it at 150 when people go to the blog … but a greater number is nicer.

*   So I was trying to find [Requests for PHP](http://requests.ryanmccue.info/) whilst talking to [the grumpy programmer](http://grumpy-phpunit.com/) and he pointed me out to [Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org/index.html) which looks equally cool
*   [Can you optimize list(genexp)](http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/can-you-optimize-listgenexp.html) is one of those geeky language internals things that could be handy to have in your back pocket
*   [Slightly Snarky GWT Debug ID FAQ](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/54558598766/slightly-snarky-gwt-debug-id-faq) – c’mon, when have you seen a more blatantly ‘put this in the smattering’ title than this?
*   [phpenv](https://github.com/CHH/phpenv) could be useful. And could be I mean ‘holy crap this is useful’ — but then again, I do actually need 3 different versions of PHP locally. YMMV
*   [Pain killing the pingponger’s decease](http://oneandonemakesthreeright.blogspot.be/2013/06/pain-killing-pingpongers-decease.html) is by their own admission not stable, but is a nice temporary solution. And illustrates why you should learn your tools — if they didn’t know about custom annotations and their runners in JUnit they would have missed this.
*   Yet another JS testing framework has grown a webdriver tentacle – [karma-webdriver-launcher](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-webdriver-launcher)
*   I barely understand a word of [Method Combinators in CoffeeScript](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2012/08/method-decorators-and-combinators-in-coffeescript.md#method-combinators-in-coffeescript) which is often a sign I should include something
*   [How are JavaScript files being served and how many are there?](http://bigqueri.es/t/how-are-javascript-files-being-served-and-how-many-are-there/36) is interesting … even if I don’t understand what/where he has put all this HAR information so one could reproduce this on their one data
*   [Statically Recompiling NES Games into Native Executables with LLVM and Go](http://andrewkelley.me/post/jamulator.html) – $entity help us if we ever need to do this level of ridiculousness to drive browsers, but holy wow its cool.
*   Remember I said I should just auto-include all of Raymond Hettinger’s SO answers? Well, here’s another one – [Python importing class attributes into method local namespace](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17006127/python-importing-class-attributes-into-method-local-namespace/17006268#17006268)
