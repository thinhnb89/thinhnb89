Apparently today’s ‘wait for an email’ task is to whittle down the smattering queue some more.

*   I won’t even pretend that [FOAAS](http://foaas.com/) has to do with automation, but makes me laugh. Also, depending on how crappy your place of work is, it might not be SFW
*   [PHP RFC: Importing namespaced functions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/use_function) is interesting if you are writing your scripts in a Functional manner. In PHP. In a future where it gets accepted and implemented.
*   [Measuring Web Page Load Times using JMeter](http://www.webperformance.com/load-testing/blog/2013/05/measuring-web-page-load-times-using-jmeter/) — and read the response articles too for clarification / elaboration
*   I kinda like that Se suites are making their way into large projects such as [Moodle’s functional-test-suite repo](https://github.com/moodlehq/functional-test-suite). But at the same time it worries me when it hasn’t had a commit in 10 months. Suites should likely change even more than the app code it exercises
*   [jasmine tactics screencast](http://searls.testdouble.com/posts/2013-03-21-jasmine-tactics-screencast.html) — on the long list of tools I should learn
*   [Introducing the Mogotest Jenkins Plugin](http://blog.mogotest.com/2013/03/25/introducing-the-mogotest-jenkins-plugin/) – hurray for more pipeline integration points
*   [The DOM isn’t slow, you are.](http://blog.korynunn.com/javascript/the-dom-isnt-slow-you-are/) — set the phasers on snark, and then read it anyways.
*   [Cross-Browser, Event-based, Element Resize Detection](http://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/) – edges are sharp.
*   [There is No ROI in Social Media Marketing](http://www.copyblogger.com/social-media-marketing-roi/) – read this, and now read it again swapping in Functional Automation everywhere
*   [Now Available: Pocket Guide to Colour Accessibility](http://hellogeri.com/blog/view/now_available_pocket_guide_to_colour_accessibility) could, in theory, be translated into a set of ‘rules’ to validate pages against since we can the colour of elements and their computed css values.
