Trying to find every excuse not to cut the grass … including apparently closing some browser tabs.

*   [Interoperability – Standardized Test Information Interchange](http://idtus.com/blog/interoperability-standardized-test-information-interchange/) has me so full of ‘meh’ as to be hilarious. Commercially driven standards rarely are and/or I am just too much of an open source person to accept this model for standards development
*   [Licensing in a Post Copyright World](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/7/23/licensing/) – important
*   [How to Make Async Requests in PHP](https://segment.io/blog/how-to-make-async-requests-in-php/) is php specific in its solution, but has some interesting bits about socket establishment that applies to other ones as well
*   [Adding Comments to JSON](http://fadefade.com/json-comments.html) feels like a hack. Buts a clever hack.
*   [Maven Release Plugin: The Final Nail in the Coffin](http://axelfontaine.com/blog/final-nail.html) takes great joy in removing part of the maven environment from their workflow. And really, who doesn’t?
*   [Open Sourcing a Python Project the Right Way](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/) is nice … though of course, as with everything else these days, it has some Github specific isms.

*   [Headless Watir](http://ihaztehcodez.michael-lloyd-lee.me.uk/2013/07/headless-watir.html) using both HTTPUnit and PhantomJS
*   [Implementing HTTP Status Codes in WebDriver, Part 2: Achievement Unlocked](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2013/08/implementing-http-status-codes-in.html) – umm, part 2?
*   [PhantomJS + Plugins + AWS + BrowserMob Proxy](http://selenium34.wordpress.com/2013/08/14/phantomjs-plugins-aws-browsermob-proxy/) – proxy all the things! Including headless things.
*   [Mastering the Craft](http://teddziuba.com/post/58003369831/mastering-the-craft) is a good reminder, but also, eBay has its own customized version of eclipse? Guessing this is one of those ‘at scale’ solutions
