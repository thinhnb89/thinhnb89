40-ish minutes until midnight eastern so that counts as two days in a row, right? Right?

*   [Improving jenkins execution times by common sense](http://tobiasgeyer.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/improving-jenkins-execution-times-by-common-sense/) — common sense. sadly lacking most days.
*   [How to make test automation more effective?](http://www.testinggeek.com/how-to-make-test-automation-more-effective) is useful up until the pitch at the end. So read until you get to that.
*   [Data Structures for PHP Devs: Trees](http://phpmaster.com/data-structures-2/) – non-trivial data structures are non-trivial
*   [Writing clean WebDriver test suites for “duplicate” functionality by parameterizing on page objects](http://c089.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/writing-clean-webdriver-test-suites-for-duplicate-functionality-by-parameterizing-on-page-objects/) – I especially like the usage of ‘might’ at the top
*   [dalek-internal-webdriver](https://npmjs.org/package/dalek-internal-webdriver) – what’s a day without a JS webdriver implementation?
*   [Antialiasing 101](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/antialiasing-101/) – I kinda think that automators should just spend a day reading this site rather than reddit
*   [RSpec 2.14 is released!](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2013/07/rspec-2-14-is-released)
*   [HTTP/2 Status Update](http://www.chmod777self.com/2013/07/http2-status-update.html) – Ugh.
*   [PHP 5.5: Generators](http://thephp.cc/viewpoints/blog/2013/07/php-5-5-generators) – You know, with yesterday’s phpenv I’m almost tempted to make some of my stuff PHP 5.5…
*   [Program Like a Machinist](http://arrgyle.com/blog/program-like-a-machinist/) – hurray for understanding the motorcycle example!
