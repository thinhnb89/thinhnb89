*   Alright, this is also snark, but [Why not make your URLs responsive?](http://responsiveurl.co.uk/while/were/making/every/damn/thing/responsive/lets/not/forget/the/url/) is an interesting ‘how would I automate this?’ question
*   [Adoption Of Exploratory Testing And Test Automation On The Rise](http://www.toolsjournal.com/testing-articles/item/1093-adoption-of-exploratory-testing-and-test-automation-on-rise) is kinda sales-y \[which is fine given the context\], but if you swap in ‘Selenium IDE’ or ‘Selenium Builder’ for ‘TestStudio’ then you have the case for those parts of the suite.
*   [web++](https://github.com/konteck/wpp) is a single file webserver — in c++
*   [From 15 hours to 15 seconds: reducing a crushing build time](http://www.songkick.com/devblog/2012/07/16/from-15-hours-to-15-seconds-reducing-a-crushing-build-time/) is pretty good, though some very obvious developer tendencies sneaking in.

*   Your periodic reminder that [Simply Writing Tests Is Not Test Driven Development](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/12/06/writing-tests-is-not-tdd)

Welcome to the JS Executor future. Honest, those aren’t thumbscrews you see on the counter over there. Why are you looking at the counter?!?!
*   [HTML5 canvas performance: Drawing circles](http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2012/12/13/html5-canvas-performance-drawing-circles) — timing is something we’ll also have to care about in HTML5 apps.
*   [Falsehoods programmers believe about build systems](http://pozorvlak.livejournal.com/174763.html). Yes.
