[Alice Finch builds massive LEGO Hogwarts from 400,000 bricks](http://www.brothers-brick.com/2013/02/26/alice-finch-builds-massive-lego-hogwarts-from-400000-bricks/) starts out at awesome and goes somewhere further down the scale when you get to the photo that shows scale.

*   [Models of Automation](http://exploringuncertainty.com/blog/archives/1010) — really, who reading this hasn’t had the conversation described in there in one of its variants
*   [Stop Moving So I Can Click You Dammit!](http://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2013/02/stop-moving-so-i-can-click-you-dammit/) – illustrates the only acceptable place for Thread.sleep()
*   [Using Realistic Data in Unit Testing](http://blog.simontimms.com/2013/02/25/using-realistic-data-in-unit-testing/) and [AngelaSmith: Creating Test Data](http://blog.simontimms.com/2013/02/26/angelasmith-creating-test-data/) is a two-for for the C# crowd — though the ideas resonate with everyone else
*   [How to handle common components with Page Object Model?](http://www.testinggeek.com/test-automation-how-to-handle-common-components-with-page-object-model) — I tend to use Inheritance, though am experimenting with Composition. The right solution is likely ‘both’
*   [Dear Nic, Should we log directly?](http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2013_02/dear-nic-says-jim) illustrates the good and bad of unix pipes
*   [How foreach actually works](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057671/how-foreach-actually-works/) was found via a snarky tweet, but is great
*   [Introducing the HTML5 Hard Disk Filler&tm; API](http://feross.org/fill-disk/) is hilarious. And the next salvo in the WebKit vs mono-culture battle
*   [HTML’s New Template Tag – Standardizing Client-Side Templating](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/template/) — look! More HTML5 madness! And no automation suggestions / gotchas. But HTML5 Rocks is a great site anyways
*   [Why your web app should be responsive](http://watirmelon.com/2013/03/02/why-your-web-app-should-be-responsive/) — I’m coming to dislike the term ‘responsive’, though agree with the sentiment. Now, how does your WebDriver \[or Watir\] scripts change in order to handle this?
*   [Nyan Cat RSpec Formatter](http://mattsears.com/articles/2011/11/16/nyan-cat-rspec-formatter) is outstandlingly silly. And should be applied to all your RSpec runners. Immediately.
