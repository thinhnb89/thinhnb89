  Buckets!

Buckets!

*   I suspect that [scanner-backed-by-selenium](http://code.google.com/p/scanner-backed-by-selenium/) belongs in the ‘with great power comes great responsibility’ bucket
*   [ios-driver](http://freynaud.github.com/ios-driver/) is in the ‘wouldn’t it be nice if Apple provided this’ bucket
*   [Selenium WebDriver utility for determining when page has finished rendering](http://dkleppinger.blogspot.ca/2012/09/selenium-webdriver-utility-for.html) is in the ‘ADF specific’ bucket’
*   I suspect [JSErrorCollector](https://github.com/mguillem/JSErrorCollector) is in the ‘already indirectly linked to’ bucket. If not then its in the ‘FF only’ bucket
*   [Using a business readable language for browser automation](http://gabrielprioli.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/using-a-business-readable-language-for-browser-automation/) is in the ‘bdd/atdd hype’ bucket. But is also in Haskell which is kinda interesting for an Se article
*   [reality is expensive: a better way of thinking about mock objects](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/reality-is-expensive-a-better-way-of-thinking-about-mock-objects) – Yup. ‘Fake bucket implementation’ bucket.
*   The bits in [Android’s tablet quality](http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html) page would be even nicer if Android wasn’t in the ‘openly hostile to automate’ bucket.
*   [Data Attributes Rock – As Both Css and Javascript Know Them](http://christianheilmann.com/2012/10/10/data-attributes-rock-as-both-css-and-javascript-know-them/) — HTML5’s data attributes are firmly in the ‘raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens’ bucket.
*   [Stop Using Story Points](http://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/) gets added to the ‘read the comments as well’ bucket. Also the ‘this is how we accrue automation debt, kids’ bucket.
*   **[Large scale automation with jenkins](http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/large-scale-automation-with-jenkins "Large scale automation with jenkins")** from **[Kohsuke Kawaguchi](http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke)**
    
    . Oh, and the ‘woohoo! I already do this stuff’ bucket.
