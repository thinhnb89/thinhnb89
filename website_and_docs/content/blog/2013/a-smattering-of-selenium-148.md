Gotta start this up again…

*   [The Evil Tester Guide To HTTP Proxies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zImieKjgfF2mvTEfLhkKnJpBrsq-shMWz1DMb-fxOoQ/edit#slide=id.gc15489c2_3_0) appears to be more for using proxies for manual testing, but you _should_ be running your automation through one as well so it helps to understand the magic that takes place.
*   New [BrowserMob Proxy](http://bmp.lightbody.net/) release. Bindings should all be updated for the newly exposed methods in a couple days.
*   [5 Things You Should Stop Doing With jQuery](http://flippinawesome.org/2013/05/06/5-things-you-should-stop-doing-with-jquery/#__sid=0) – Not sure whats better, the content, or the Saved By The Bell theme
*   [testtools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools) is the latest hotness in the world of Python runners?
*   [Boris](https://github.com/d11wtq/boris) looks pretty useful for the PHP folks
*   [Google’s Scaled Trunk Based Development](http://paulhammant.com/2013/05/06/googles-scaled-trunk-based-development/) – even if you are not Google, you should be doing this. Or as much as you can (again, you are likely not Google)
*   [Reliably Testing Asynchronous UI W/ RSpec and Capybara](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/02/03/reliably-testing-asynchronous-ui-w-slash-rspec-and-capybara/) isn’t new, but the _wait\_for\_dom_ thing is new \[to me\]
*   [In defense of <canvas>](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/in-defense-of-canvas/) – canvas worries me
*   [One Does Not Simply Set Profile for Remote Chrome](http://filipin.eu/one-does-not-simply-set-profile-for-remote-chrome/) is Watir, but links to the pure WebDriver in SO article. I don’t think any of the other bindings deliver chrome profiles over the wire…
*   [The Moodle Functional Test Automation Harness](https://github.com/moodlehq/functional-test-suite) – always fun to peek into other’s suites
