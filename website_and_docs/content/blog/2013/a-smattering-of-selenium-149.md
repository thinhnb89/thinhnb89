Too. Many. Tabs.

*   [Internationalization and Localization Testing](http://watirmelon.com/2013/05/30/internationalization-and-localization-testing/) — yup, I agree.
*   [5 HTML5 Features you need to know](http://daker.me/2013/05/5-html5-features-you-need-to-know.html) – ‘download attribute’ and ‘datalist element’ might be a pain for us automators. Or at least cause a couple hours annoyance until we figure out the pattern.
*   [Death to sleeps! Raise of Conditions!](http://minds.coremedia.com/2013/06/03/death-to-sleeps-raise-of-conditions/) – expected conditions is likely the next thing to get more marketing this year
*   [line\_profiler and kernprof](http://pythonhosted.org/line_profiler/) – profiling is black magic voodoo
*   [Naught](https://github.com/avdi/naught) – ‘Naught is a toolkit for building Null Objects in Ruby.’
*   [Replacing a substring of a string with Python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10436454/replacing-a-substring-of-a-string-with-python/10436832) – Raymond’s answers always simultaneously break my break and blow my mind.

*   [So you want to build a framework](http://element34.ca/blog/so-you-want-to-build-a-framework) – mine, but important. (I think.)
*   [Locks, Actors, And STM In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-05-15-Locks,-Actors,-And-STM-In-Pictures.html) – ya! pictures!
*   [Packaging a ruby script as an Windows exe using OCRA](http://watirmelon.com/2013/05/14/packaging-a-ruby-script-as-an-windows-exe-using-ocra/) looks like something useful
