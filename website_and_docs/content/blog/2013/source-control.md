This short technical note is to announce that the Selenium project is now using [git on Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout) in place of subversion.

The move has been a long time in the making, and it’s largely thanks to the efforts of [Kristian Rosenvold](https://twitter.com/krosenvold) that we’ve been able to do the migration and retain the project history. The project owes him a huge thank you! We’re in the process of migrating the last bits and pieces (none of which are user facing), so there may be some last minute turbulence as we settle everything down.

Although the canonical source will be on [Google Code](http://selenium.googlecode.com/), we’re working on setting up a github mirror. We’ll announce the location of that once it’s set up.
