Three in a row … of course, these are the easy three.

*   [Build, test and deploy Firefox OS apps for $0](http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2013/build-test-and-deploy-firefox-os-apps-for-0.html) (or any other currency that I don’t know how to emit)
*   Ruby on Rails … in Bash. Because they can. [Bash on Balls](https://github.com/jayferd/balls)
*   [All you need to know about CSS Transitions](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/css-transitions) except how the hell we are going to synchronize on them. Well, kinda does, but this is going to hurt.
*   [Speed Up Web Testing with a Caching Proxy](http://blog.mogotest.com/2013/01/03/speed-up-web-testing-with-a-caching-proxy/) has a speed-up trick I hadn’t thought of yet. And it also further complicates the moving parts in automation.
*   [Rails SQL injection vulnerability: hold your horses, here are the facts](http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/03/rails-sql-injection-vulnerability-hold-your-horses-here-are-the-facts) – I think every vulnerability should have a write-up like this.
*   I hope I never feel the need to investigate an operator the way [PHP equal operator ==](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=492) does.
*   Now, investigating runners is something I’ve had to do a couple times.

*   [Using macros to create custom example groups in RSpec](http://jorgemanrubia.net/2010/01/16/using-macros-to-create-custom-example-groups-in-rspec/)
*   [Hamcrest Quick Reference](http://www.marcphilipp.de/blog/2013/01/02/hamcrest-quick-reference/). Print it out and pin it to your wall.
*   This. Is. Awesome. [Mozpol – Provisioning Pandas](https://blog.mozilla.org/it/2013/01/04/mozpool/)
