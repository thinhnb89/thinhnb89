This year’s [Selenium Conference](http://www.seleniumconf.org/) is slated for June 10 – 12 in beautiful Boston, Massachusetts. The conference will be held at the [Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel](http://www.seleniumconf.org/venue/). Similar to last year, this year’s conference will kick off with a full day of Selenium Workshops, followed by a two day, two track conference. If you’ve always dreamed of speaking at a Selenium Conference there’s still time to submit a talk to us at [http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/](http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/).

As we have done every year, we’re pleased to announce that a batch of early bird tickets to the Conference is on sale now, even before the talks have been finalized. You can get your ticket(s) by visiting [http://seconf2013.eventbrite.com/](http://seconf2013.eventbrite.com/). There are only 45 early bird tickets available at the special rate of $299, and they are only available until February 4th, so act now! After that the regular price of $350 will be in effect for all tickets. You’ll also notice that tickets to our workshop day are for sale as well. These cost $75 and entitle you to attend a full day of Selenium workshops on Monday June 10th.

More information on the conference is available at [http://www.seleniumconf.org/](http://www.seleniumconf.org/), and we are still accepting speaker proposals. We’re looking forward to seeing you in June!
