*   [phpci](http://www.phptesting.org/) is built specifically for php apps, and doesn’t pretend to have the features something like jenkins does
*   [Beware subclassing Ruby core classes](http://words.steveklabnik.com/beware-subclassing-ruby-core-classes) – there are likely parallels in other languages as well.
