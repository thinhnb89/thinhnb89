*   [Referencing DOM from JS: there must be a DRYer, safer way](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2013/06/referencing-dom-from-js-there-must-be.html) is a nice ‘here is where I started, and here is how I ended up where I am’ post which can be stolen into other languages / frameworks other than in Backbone
*   [Hash lookup in Ruby, why is it so fast?](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/hash-lookup-in-ruby-why-is-it-so-fast) is not something I was wondering, but now I know why.
*   [Nobody understands the GIL](http://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/8100871-nobody-understands-the-gil-part-2-implementation) – in any language.
*   [Resource Locator Discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/php-fig/WMaKNNhHZJw/Waib99Zzf68J) – namespace all the things!
*   [How to Survive the Coming Test Automation Zombie Apocalypse](http://dhemery.com/pdf/test-automation-zombie-apocalypse.pdf) is abso-freaking-lutely awesome
*   [Blackhole proxy to block all external calls](https://gist.github.com/dimacus/5757573) is a snippet that came out of SeConf this week
*   [Filter a list into two parts](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201306/filter_a_list_into_two_parts.html). Ouch. My brain just broke. (But generators do that to me.)
*   [What you need to know about dates and times in computing](http://www.amazon.com/about-dates-times-computing-ebook/dp/B00DCJZDYE/) could be useful. If one kindles.
*   [SSL Helpers](https://gist.github.com/wolever/5762823) is a couple python scripts for manipulating certificates
*   [storyautomation](http://storyautomation.com/) seems to have a number of decent posts. Of course, they are around RC so I was hesitant to link to it, but it looks like the ideas could transpose up to WebDriver
