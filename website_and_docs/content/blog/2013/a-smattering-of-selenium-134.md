Hrm. Office is closed until Monday, but everyone is in. Very confusing…

*   One reason I have heard people say they don’t use cloud instances is they are afraid they will just sit around idle when not needed. [Behind the clouds: how RelEng do Firefox builds on AWS](http://atlee.ca/blog/2012/12/14/behind-the-clouds/) has some useful scripts to find and teardown machines.
*   [Page Weight Matters](http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters) is a fun little insight into how/why YouTube shed some of its heft. And a reminder that what we need is more stuff coming out of bandwidth starved regions since we have forgotten how to program efficiently in North America / Europe.
*   [Usetrace](http://usetrace.com) looks like the newest player in the Selenium-in-the-cloud space. Seems to use the Python bindings as the scripting language and host the scripts too.
*   Did you know that you can modify the Se Server’s Grid functionality with plugins? Neither did I — or at least I don’t think I did… Here is a [tutorial](https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial) and [another example](https://github.com/AutomatedTester/speedy-gonzales-proxy).
*   The interesting part of [Whose bug is this anyway?!?](http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/whose-bug-is-this-anyway) is ‘Your computer is broken’ bit. Oh, and make sure that build machine is updated to what your developers are running…
*   [Modeling How Programmers Read Code](http://synesthesiam.com/?p=218) is just cool.
*   Speaking of reading code; [Code Reading](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/12/23/code-reading). I wonder if you gave this to a novice programmer if they would approach the above link differently.
*   [PhantomJS 1.8 “Blue Winter Rose”](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/12/phantomjs-1-8-blue-winter-rose.html) got lots of twitter love. As it should have.
*   [Cooperative multitasking using coroutines (in PHP!)](http://nikic.github.com/2012/12/22/Cooperative-multitasking-using-coroutines-in-PHP.html) is, I think, pretty awesome just by the my inability to fully grok what is going on. I also have no idea how to use this for automation purposes, but it seems like there should be some usage for it somewhere…
*   [So You Want to Write Tests](http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2012/12/17/so-you-want-to-write-tests) is more mindset than code … but code has always been the easy part anyways.
