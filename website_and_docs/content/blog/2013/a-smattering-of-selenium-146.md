Happy ‘productivity destructive week’ — otherwise known as March break.

*   [How to Accept Self-Signed SSL Certificates in Selenium 2](http://blog.mogotest.com/2013/03/05/how-to-accept-self-signed-ssl-certificates-in-selenium2/) — or you could use ‘real’ certificates that are trusted by the browser by default. If you are using self-signed certificates to ‘save money’ and you spend 3 hours making it work, you are not saving money anymore
*   [JockeyJS](https://github.com/tcoulter/jockeyjs) seems like it could be useful
*   Dear every-js-widget-library-author, [You can’t create a button](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/01/29/you-cant-create-a-button/)
*   If you are using PHP, then [The Grumpy Programmer’s PHPUnit Cookbook](http://grumpy-phpunit.com/) should be added to your reading pile. Thankfully he doesn’t touch on the built-in WebDriver stuff but the ToC still looks relevant to what we do
*   [WordPress Performance Optimization](http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/02/07/web-performance-optimization-automation/) is just cool — and could provide tricks for your non-WordPress apps too
*   [Single-Session Development](http://blog.veez.us/single-session-development) is something I don’t do — but can appreciate the geek-ness of this
*   [JUnit’s evolving structure](http://edmundkirwan.com/general/junit.html) shows what the, erm, evolving structure of JUnit and has the killer line of ‘Programmers should be forced to wear their systems’ package-structures on their tee-shirts.’
*   [Basic Authentication With the BrowserMob Proxy](http://element34.ca/blog/basic-authentication-with-the-browsermob-proxy), wow, that’s an annoying edge-case
*   [Breaking Down Amazon’s Mega Dropdown](http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown) – ugh, because mouse events weren’t hard enough without menus tracking and rendering based on its position
*   If you are intro RSpec, then [RSpec Next Steps](http://rspec-next-steps.herokuapp.com/) is going to be for you. Even if it does use a horrid html-based deck format (use the left/right arrow keys to navigate)
