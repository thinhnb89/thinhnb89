Brain fried from PyCon Canada 2013 and ‘some’ browser tab is misbehaving which means its time to start closing some of these.

*   [Patchwork](http://antecedent.github.io/patchwork/) seems like an awesome idea, but at the same time, I’ve had to work in heavily monkey-patched RoR apps before…
*   [Evolving syntax](https://igor.io/2013/07/26/evolving-syntax.html) is PHP specific in its examples, but the ideas transfer
*   [Roslyn + Selenium: Scripty C# Powering Browser Automation](http://adaptengine.com/blog/2013/07/24/roslyn-plus-selenium-scripty-csharp-powering-browser-automation/) – some C# voodoo?
*   [It’s like 10000 knives when all you need is a Spoon](http://dnlkntt.wordpress.com/2013/08/07/its-like-10000-knives-when-all-you-need-is-a-spoon/) – or specifically, this particular spoon which is yet-another-android-automation-tool. See comments for a bit of discussion re Appium which seems to be the currently best marketed solution in this space
*   [Planet generator](http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/torbenm/Planet/) has absolutely nothing to do with automation, but is just cool
*   [TestSpicer](http://www.testspicer.com/) could be cool if it is massively flushed out
*   [Compatibility changes in IE11 Preview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/bg182625(v=vs.110).aspx) is going to break things I fear, for instance the readyState stuff?
*   [PyCon Canada 2013 decks](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconca) are now up
*   [Implementing WebDriver HTTP Status Codes, Part 1: Challenge Accepted](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2013/08/implementing-webdriver-http-status.html) – is interesting in that it uses Fiddler
*   [Links are not buttons. Neither are DIVs and SPANs](http://www.karlgroves.com/2013/05/14/links-are-not-buttons-neither-are-divs-and-spans/) – this, a million times.
